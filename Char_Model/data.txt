Look at her face, it's a wonderful face  
And it means something special to me  
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
How lucky can one fellow be?  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?  
  
And when we go for a walk in the park  
And she holds me and squeezes my hand  
We'll go on walking for hours and talking  
About all the things that we plan  
  
She's just my kind of girl, she makes me feel fine  
Who could ever believe that she could be mine?  
She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue  
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do?


Take it easy with me, please  
Touch me gently like a summer evening breeze  
Take your time, make it slow  
Andante, Andante  
Just let the feeling grow  
  
Make your fingers soft and light  
Let your body be the velvet of the night  
Touch my soul, you know how  
Andante, Andante  
Go slowly with me now  
  
I'm your music  
(I am your music and I am your song)  
I'm your song  
(I am your music and I am your song)  
Play me time and time again and make me strong  
(Play me again 'cause you're making me strong)  
Make me sing, make me sound  
(You make me sing and you make me)  
Andante, Andante  
Tread lightly on my ground  
Andante, Andante  
Oh please don't let me down  
  
There's a shimmer in your eyes  
Like the feeling of a thousand butterflies  
Please don't talk, go on, play  
Andante, Andante  
And let me float away  
  
I'm your music  
(I am your music and I am your song)  
I'm your song  
(I am your music and I am your song)  
Play me time and time again and make me strong  
(Play me again 'cause you're making me strong)  
Make me sing, make me sound  
(You make me sing and you make me)  
Andante, Andante  
Tread lightly on my ground  
Andante, Andante  
Oh please don't let me down  
  
Make me sing, make me sound  
(You make me sing and you make me)  
Andante, Andante  
Tread lightly on my ground  
Andante, Andante  
Oh please don't let me down  
Andante, Andante  
Oh please don't let me down


I'll never know why I had to go  
Why I had to put up such a lousy rotten show  
Boy, I was tough, packing all my stuff  
Saying I don't need you anymore, I've had enough  
And now, look at me standing here again 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta have you near  
  
As good as new, my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension  
It's as good as new, my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new, thank God it's true  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together  
  
Feel like a creep, never felt so cheap  
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep  
How could I make such a dumb mistake  
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break  
But please, baby, I beg you to forgive 'cause I found out that  
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here  
Gotta get you near  
  
I thought that our love was at an end but here I am again  
  
As good as new, my love for you  
And keeping it that way is my intention  
As good as new and growing too  
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension  
It's as good as new, my love for you  
Just like it used to be and even better  
As good as new, thank God it's true  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together  
  
Yes the love I have for you feels as good as new  
Darling, we were always meant to stay together


Making somebody happy is a question of give and take  
You can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break  
Every smile and every little touch  
Don't you know that they mean so much  
Sweet sweet kisses so tender  
Always will return to sender  
  
Like a bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum  
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum  
So give it away, I think you'll learn  
You'll get love in return  
So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love  
A boom-a-boomerang is love  
  
Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere  
When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care  
Never use it as a selfish tool  
Never ever be such a fool  
Every feeling you're showing  
Is a boomerang you're throwing  
  
Yes a bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum  
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum  
So give it away, I think you'll learn  
You'll get love in return  
So bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love  
  
And if you're warm and tender  
I'll kiss you, return to sender  
Please surrender  
  
Bang, a boom-a-boomerang  
Dum-be-dum-dum be-dum-be-dum-dum  
Oh bang, a boom-a-boomerang is love  
A boom-a-boomerang is love

Well, you hoot and you holler and you make me mad  
And I've always been under your heel  
Holy christ what a lousy deal  
Now I'm sick and tired of your tedious ways  
And I ain't gonna take it no more  
Oh no no - walkin' out that door  
  
Burning my bridges, cutting my tie  
Once again I wanna look into the eye  
Being myself  
Counting my pride  
No un-right neighbour's gonna take me for a ride  
Burning my bridges  
Moving at last  
Girl I'm leaving and I'm burying the past  
Gonna have peace now  
You can be free  
No one here will make a sucker out of me


Down in the street they're all singing and shouting  
Staying alive though the city is dead  
Hiding their shame behind hollow laughter  
While you are crying alone on your bed  
  
Pity Cassandra that no one believed you  
But then again you were lost from the start  
Now we must suffer and sell our secrets  
Bargain, playing smart, aching in our hearts  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
So in the morning your ship will be sailing  
Now that your father and sister are gone  
There is no reason for you to linger  
You're grieving deeply but still moving on  
  
You know the future is casting a shadow  
No one else sees it but you know your fate  
Packing your bags, being slow and thorough  
Knowing, though you're late, that ship is sure to wait  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise  
Sails almost slack in the cool morning rain  
She stood on deck, just a tiny figure  
Rigid and restrained, blue eyes filled with pain  
  
Sorry Cassandra I misunderstood  
Now the last day is dawning  
Some of us wanted but none of us would  
Listen to words of warning  
But on the darkest of nights  
Nobody knew how to fight  
And we were caught in our sleep  
Sorry Cassandra I didn't believe  
You really had the power  
I only saw it as dreams you would weave  
Until the final hour  
  
I'm sorry Cassandra  
I'm sorry Cassandra


Chiquitita, tell me what's wrong  
You're enchained by your own sorrow  
In your eyes there is no hope for tomorrow  
How I hate to see you like this  
There is no way you can deny it  
I can see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
Chiquitita, tell me the truth  
I'm a shoulder you can cry on  
Your best friend, I'm the one you must rely on  
You were always sure of yourself  
Now I see you've broken a feather  
I hope we can patch it up together  
  
Chiquitita, you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving  
Chiquitita, you and I cry  
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
  
So the walls came tumbling down  
And your love's a blown out candle  
All is gone and it seems too hard to handle  
Chiquitita, tell me the truth  
There is no way you can deny it  
I see that you're oh so sad, so quiet  
  
Chiquitita, you and I know  
How the heartaches come and they go and the scars they're leaving  
You'll be dancing once again and the pain will end  
You will have no time for grieving  
Chiquitita, you and I cry  
But the sun is still in the sky and shining above you  
Let me hear you sing once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita  
Try once more like you did before  
Sing a new song, Chiquitita


I was out with the morning sun  
Couldn't sleep, so I thought I'd take a walk  
I was thinking of you and me  
And I went to your house, 'cause I had to talk  
  
I could hardly believe my eyes  
When I saw this guy closing your front door  
Had the feeling of emptiness like I never had before  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
As he disapeared in his car  
I was stunned and I didn't know what to do  
Everything I had ever dreamed  
  
Everything in my life's part of you  
And I just couldn't move my feet  
So I stood on the pavement as you came out  
You acted as you didn't know what it was all about  
  
And I closed my eyes, will you leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
Baby, how could you do it  
You just told me lies  
  
And you meet behind my back  
With other guys  
Baby, how could you tell me  
There was only me  
  
I was stupid to believe you  
I was blind but now I see  
Then you smiled and you took my hand  
"There is something", you said, "that you may not know  
  
There's a couple of men in my life  
And one of them is my brother Joe  
He's been gone for a long, long time  
But he's back and I think he's gonna stay  
  
You'll be seeing a lot of him, he's so nice in every way"  
Then I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
So I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world  
So I closed my eyes, never leave me girl  
Then I realized, it's a crazy world


I'm waitin' for you baby  
I'm sitting all alone  
I feel so cold without you  
It chills me to the bone  
I never thought you'd leave me  
But now I know it's true  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you  
I'm waitin' for you baby  
I'm sittin' all alone  
I feel so cold without you  
It chills me to the bone  
I never thought you'd leave me  
But now I know it's true  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you  
  
Cryin' over you  
I'm cryin' over you  
Cryin' over  
Little memories of things we used to do  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you  
Oh Lord I'm blue  
I'm cryin' over you


Oh, my love it makes me sad.  
Why did things turn out so bad?  
Was it just a dream, everything we did, everything we had?  
  
Baby, give me one more  
Dance while the music still goes on  
Don't think about tomorrow  
Dance and forget our time is gone  
Tonight's a night we borrow.  
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own  
A thing to remember when we're all alone  
So dance, it's our way to say goodbye  
  
Yes, all we have to do is  
Dance while the music still goes on  
This is no time for crying  
Dance, don't you hear them play our song  
God knows that we've been trying  
But we didn't make it 'cause nothing's the same  
We just couldn't help it, nobody's to blame  
So dance while the music still goes on  
And let it be our last goodbye  
  
Yet it seems to make me sad.  
Why did things turn out so bad?  
Was is just a dream, everything we did, everything we had?  
  
Baby, give me one last  
Dance while the music still goes on  
Just like the night I met you  
Dance and believe me, when you're gone  
You know I won't forget you  
Our love was a snowbird, it's flying away  
You tell me it's over, what more can I say?  
So dance while the music still goes on  
It's gonna be our last goodbye  
  
Dance while the music still goes on  
Don't think about tomorrow  
Dance and forget our time is gone  
Tonight's a night we borrow.  
Let's make it a memory, a night of our own  
A thing to remember when we're all alone  
So dance while the music still goes on  
And let it be our last goodbye  
  
Dance while the music still goes on  
This is no time for crying  
Dance, don't you hear them play our song  
God knows that we've been trying  
Dance while the music still goes on  
Just like the night I met you  
Dance and believe me, when you're gone  
You know I won't forget you

You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
See that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the Dancing Queen  
  
Friday night and the lights are low  
Looking out for the place to go  
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing  
You come in to look for a king  
Anybody could be that guy  
Night is young and the music's high  
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen  
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine  
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
See that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the Dancing Queen  
  
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on  
Leave them burning and then you're gone  
Looking out for another, anyone will do  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen  
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine  
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
See that girl, watch that scene, diggin' the Dancing Queen


Changing, moving in a circle  
I can see your face in all of my dreams  
Smiling, laughing from the shadows  
When I hear your voice, I know what it means  
I know it doesn't matter just how hard I try  
You're all the reason for my life  
  
Disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me  
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down  
You're all I had, you're all I want  
Disillusion, disillusions, now that's all I have  
  
Wishing, hoping, chasing shadows  
Did I see your face somewhere in the crowd  
Thinking, wondering what you're doing  
I can't stop myself from crying out loud  
They say my wound will heal and only leave a scar  
But then, they never shared our love  
  
Disillusion, disillusion's all you left for me  
How can I forget you when my world is breaking down  
You're all I had, you're all I want  
Disillusion, disillusions, now that's all I have  
  
Disillusion, disillusions, now that's all I have


You're so hot, teasing me  
So you're blue but I can't take a chance on a chick like you  
That's something I couldn't do  
There's that look in your eyes  
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild  
Ah, but girl you're only a child  
  
Well I can dance with you honey  
If you think it's funny  
Does your mother know that you're out?  
And I can chat with you baby  
Flirt a little maybe  
Does your mother know that you're out?  
  
Take it easy (take it easy)  
Better slow down girl  
That's no way to go  
Does your mother know?  
  
Take it easy (take it easy)  
Try to cool it girl  
Take it nice and slow  
Does your mother know?  
  
I can see what you want  
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun  
So maybe I'm not the one  
Now you're so cute, I like your style  
And I know what you mean when you give me a flash of that smile (smile)  
But girl you're only a child  
  
Well I can dance with you honey  
If you think it's funny  
Does your mother know that you're out?  
And I can chat with you baby  
Flirt a little maybe  
Does your mother know that you're out?  
  
Take it easy (take it easy)  
Better slow down girl  
That's no way to go  
Does your mother know?  
  
Take it easy (take it easy)  
Try to cool it girl  
Take it nice and slow  
Does your mother know?  
  
Well I can dance with you honey  
If you think it's funny  
Does your mother know that you're out?  
And I can chat with you baby  
  
Flirt a little maybe  
Does your mother know that you're out?


Agnetha We're not the stars of a Hollywood movie  
So what's the use to pretend  
I'm not so charming and you're not so groovy  
You've got to face it my friend  
  
Agnetha, Frida Dreamworld, you've been living in a dreamworld  
Trust me, you just can't escape from reality  
Boy meets girl, doesn't mean they're in a dreamworld  
Here I am, here you are,  
  
We're gonna make it together  
And within, it's a fuss  
So we can only get better  
Agnetha When you reach up and you say to me  
  
How I love you, girl  
When I hold you, baby, can't you see  
That's the way we whirl  
You had your hopes and your high expectations  
  
Somehow it doesn't seem right  
I'm getting fed-up with your acquisitions  
I'm not your angel in white  
Agnetha, Frida Dreamworld, you've been living in a dreamworld  
  
Trust me, you just can't escape from reality  
Boy meets girl, doesn't mean they're in a dreamworld

We're gonna make it together  
  
And within, it's a fuss  
So we can only get better

I can hear how you work, practising hard  
Playing night and day, wo-oh  
And it sounds better now, yes you improve  
Everytime you play, wo-oh  
But it's bad  
You're so sad  
And you're only smiling  
When you play your violin  
  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
To be so near you and not just hear you  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby  
You'd be mine  
And we'd be together all the time  
Wish I was dumb dumb diddle, your darling fiddle  
  
But I think, you don't know that I exist  
I'm the quiet kind, wo-oh  
From the day when I first listened to you  
You've been on my mind, wo-oh  
You don't care  
It's not fair  
And you're only smiling  
When you play your violin  
  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
To be so near you and not just hear you  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby  
You'd be mine  
And we'd be together all the time  
  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
To be so near you and not just hear you  
Dumb dumb diddle, to be your fiddle  
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby  
You'd be mine  
And we'd be together all the time  
Wish I was dumb dumb diddle, your darling find


They came flying from far away, now I'm under their spell  
I love hearing the stories that they tell  
They've seen places beyond my land and they've found new horizons  
They speak strangely but I understand  
  
And I dream I'm an eagle  
And I dream I can spread my wings  
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky  
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze  
High, high, what a feeling to fly  
Over mountains and forests and seas  
And to go anywhere that I please  
  
As all good friends we talk all night, and we fly wing to wing  
I have questions and they know everything  
There's no limit to what I feel, we climb higher and higher  
Am I dreaming or is it all real?  
  
Is it true I'm an eagle?  
Is it true I can spread my wings?  
Flying high, high, I'm a bird in the sky (I'm an eagle)  
I'm an eagle that rides on the breeze  
High, high, what a feeling to fly (What a feeling)  
Over mountains and forests and seas  
And to go anywhere that I please


Every good man needs a helping hand  
so I travel alone if I can  
Every man has a guiding star  
and he knows what he's gonna get  
when he's going too far  
  
Living on the dark side once again  
It's sad to lose a friend  
Looking at things with empty feelings  
Still we're going on  
  
For Every good man needs a helping hand  
I should have known too  
Some of us learn too late, I'm sorry  
Every good man needs a helping hand  
It's true  
  
Every good man needs a helping hand  
so I travel alone if I can  
Every man has a guiding star  
and he knows  
what he's gonna get  
when he's going too far  
  
Living on the dark side once again  
It's sad to lose a friend  
Looking at things with empty feelings  
Still we're going on  
  
For Every good man needs a helping hand  
I should have known too  
Some of us learn too late, I'm sorry  
Every good man needs a helping hand  
It's true


Can you hear the drums Fernando?  
I remember long ago another starry night like this  
In the firelight Fernando  
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar  
I could hear the distant drums  
And sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar  
  
They were closer now Fernando  
Every hour every minute seemed to last eternally  
I was so afraid Fernando  
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die  
And I'm not ashamed to say  
The roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry  
  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
  
Now we're old and grey Fernando  
And since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand  
Can you hear the drums Fernando?  
Do you still recall the frightful night we crossed the Rio Grande?  
I can see it in your eyes  
How proud you were to fight for freedom in this land  
  
(Repeat x2)  
There was something in the air that night  
The stars were bright, Fernando  
They were shining there for you and me  
For liberty, Fernando  
Though I never thought that we could lose  
There's no regret  
If I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando  
  
Yes, if I had to do the same again  
I would, my friend, Fernando...


Puedes escuchar Fernando?  
Me recuerda tiempo atras  
Estrellas y una noche alla  
En la lumbre azul Fernando  
Tarareabas tu cancion  
Con ese suave guitarrear  
Yo podia escuchar  
Esos tambores con un sordo redoblar  
  
Se acercaban mas fernando  
Y el momento que pasaba  
Parecia eternidad  
Y senti temor Fernando  
Por la vida y juventud  
Nadie pensaba en morir  
Y no siento hoy verguenza al  
Confesar que tuve  
Ganas de llorar  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
  
La vejez llego Fernando  
Y con ella una paz  
Que hoy logramos disfrutar  
Se durmio el tambor Fernando  
Paraciera que fue ayer  
Que lo vivimos tu y yo  
Y en tus ojos veo aun  
Aquel orgullo que refleja tu valor.  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
  
Algo habia alrededor quiza  
De claridad Fernando  
Que brillaba por nosotros dos  
En proteccion Fernando  
No pensabamos jamas perder  
Ni echar atras  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando  
  
Si tuviera que volverlo a hacer  
Lo haria ya Fernando

I'm down and I feel depressed  
Sitting here just waiting  
For next bus travelling  
Downtown  
It's a crying shame  
Isn't it  
The beautiful weather  
If I could have my way  
Well, I would not be working  
On a day like this I know what I'd like to be  
As free as a bumble bee  
Take a sip from  
Every flower  
Free as a bumble bee  
While away each lazy hour  
What a good life  
Lying laid back  
Like an old railroad bum by the track  
What a good life  
Living outdoors  
Lie in the grass and chew on a straw


Twinkle, Twinkle little star  
How I wonder what you are  
Like a diamond glitt'ring in the sky  
Seems to me you shine your light  
Down to me to say goodnight  
Twinkle, Twinkle my old friend  
Sleep is waiting round the bend  
While you travel through the milky way  
From afar  
Twinkle, Twinkle, Twinkle little star.  
  
Raindrops on a window pane  
Stillness of a summer rain  
Silently the haze drifts through the trees  
Slowly dawn is breaking through  
Yet a morning without you  
  
Curtins rustling in the breeze  
I'm still trapped within my dreams  
Daylight makes it's way into my mind  
Coming through  
Yet another morning without you.  
  
Finally when darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes backs to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Mmm, Mmm, Mmm- echoes of a voice I knew  
  
Half awake in half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room.  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Long awaited darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warms my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes back to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room.


Half past twelve  
And I'm watching the late show in my flat all alone  
How I hate to spend the evening on my own  
Autumn winds  
Blowing outside my window as I look around the room  
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
  
Movie stars  
Find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win  
It's so different from the world I'm living in  
Tired of T. V.  
I open the window and I gaze into the night  
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight...  
  
There's not a soul out there  
No-one to hear my prays  
  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away  
Gimme gimme gimme a man after midnight  
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day


There's a gentleness to everything you do  
And it's rubbing off on me I feel it too  
I've been waiting but my loneliness I get  
When you call me on the phone  
And I'm feeling so alone  
When you ask me to come over  
Baby you know I will  
I could never stay on my own  
  
Givin' it all I got to give  
I've never done that before  
I'm always givin' a little more  
When I'm with you  
  
Givin' it all I got to give  
I've never done that before  
I'm always givin' a little more  
When I'm with you  
I'm always givin' a little more  
When I'm with you  
  
Givin' it all I got to give  
I've never done that before  
I'm always givin' a little more  
When I'm with you  
Givin' it all I got to give  
I've never done that before  
I'm always givin' a little more


You say she's been mad at you  
Then you say you'll be patient, ooh  
Still I see that she makes you blue  
Come on, I'll give you consolation  
  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna bring you some light  
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna make it all right  
You're all I ever need, my darling  
  
Just to be where you want to be  
So much fun we could have then, hmm  
To be close for eternity  
What a miracle to happen  
  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna sing it for you  
Gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too  
Gonna sing you my love song, when I think about you  
I know she doesn't make it easy  
'Cause you don't please her like you please me  
  
You're my life, you're my angel  
You're my first, you're my last  
Would she care if you lingered  
For another night  
Want to hold you tight  
We could make it right  
  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna bring you some light  
Gonna make you feel happy every day of your life  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna make it all right  
I know she doesn't make it easy  
Gonna sing you my love song, gonna sing it for you  
Gonna give you sweet loving, gonna give myself too  
Gonna sing you my love song, when I think about you  
You're all I ever need, my darling  
And I would love to sing my love song  
For you


When the autumn leaves are falling to the ground  
When the air gets cold then I think of us  
Of you and I  
And it almost makes me cry  
So sad and kind of bitter sweet  
And the memories filled with tears  
And I feel my heart will break  
Guess it all was my mistake  
  
Autumn's chilly winds were blowing through the trees  
The rain fell softly on your face  
Oh I remember every little thing about that day  
I remember every place  
Grey skies, you were laughing at the clouds  
The rain fell softly on your face  
The memories of our time together cannot be replaced  
I never loved you more than on those happy autumn days


Agnetha, Frida Early this morning I drove in the rain  
Out to the airport to get on the plain  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii  
Alice has been there, she said it was fun  
  
Swimming and surfing, enjoying the sun  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii  
After all I had to go through, I'm making no plans  
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance  
  
Guess I've been working a little to hard  
Need a vacation, I'll send you a card  
From Honolulu, a greeting from happy Hawaii  
It's so exciting, why should I pretend  
  
In a few hours the plane will descend  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii  
I can imagine the beach and the sand  
Walking with someone and holding his hand  
  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii  
After all I had to go through, I'm making no plans  
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance  
I've got a feeling, the dream will come true  
  
Someone is waiting and I forget you  
Hey Honolulu, I'm going to happy Hawaii


No more champagne  
And the fireworks are through  
Here we are, me and you  
Feeling lost and feeling blue  
It's the end of the party  
And the morning seems so grey  
So unlike yesterday  
Now's the time for us to say  
  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have a vision now and then  
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have our hopes, our will to try  
If we don't we might as well lay down and die  
You and I  
  
Sometimes I see  
How the brave new world arrives  
And I see how it thrives  
In the ashes of our lives  
Oh yes, man is a fool  
And he thinks he'll be okay  
Dragging on, feet of clay  
Never knowing he's astray  
Keeps on going anyway  
  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have a vision now and then  
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have our hopes, our will to try  
If we don't we might as well lay down and die  
You and I  
  
Seems to me now  
That the dreams we had before  
Are all dead, nothing more  
Than confetti on the floor  
It's the end of a decade  
In another ten years time  
Who can say what we'll find  
What lies waiting down the line  
In the end of eighty-nine  
  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have a vision now and then  
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend  
Happy New Year  
Happy New Year  
May we all have our hopes, our will to try  
If we don't we might as well lay down and die  
You and I


Benny I was a fighter, always looking for trouble  
And my life was so empty, there was nothing to live for  
But then it happened one night  
As I got into a fight  
I could hear someone saying  
As though he was praying  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
You might need his help one day  
We depend one one another  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
On the road  
That we're going  
We all need  
Words of comfort and compassion  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
I was a woman, never thinking of others  
And my life was so lonely, didn't care for anybody  
But then I happened to meet  
A begging man in the street  
As I turned down his praying  
I heard someone saying  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
You might need his help one day  
We depend one one another  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
On the road  
That we're going  
We all need  
Words of comfort and compassion  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
You might need his help one day  
We depend one one another  
Love him, that's the only way  
  
Treat him well, he is your brother  
You might need his help one day  
We depend one one another  
Love him, that's the only way


I have a very good friend  
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend  
She has a personal style  
Some people love it others tend to go wild  
You hear her voice everywhere  
Taking the chair  
She's a leading lady  
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
Head over heels  
Breaking her way  
Pushing through unknown jungles every day  
She's a girl with a taste for the world  
(The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
Head over heels  
Setting the pace  
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
She's extreme if you know what I mean  
  
Her man is one I admire  
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired  
Each time when he speaks his mind  
She pats his head and says that's all very fine  
Exert that will of your own  
When you're alone  
Now we better hurry  
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
Head over heels  
Breaking her way  
Pushing through unknown jungles every day  
She's a girl with a taste for the world  
(The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
Head over heels  
Setting the pace  
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
She's extreme if you know what I mean  
  
You hear her voice everywhere  
Taking the chair  
She's a leading lady  
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going  
  
Head over heels  
Breaking her way  
Pushing through unknown jungles every day  
She's a girl with a taste for the world  
(The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)  
Head over heels  
Setting the pace  
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace  
She's extreme if you know what I mean  
(She's just one of those who always has to do whatever she please)  
And she goes  
Head over heels


Love, love is a dream  
We were like two young strands of driftwood  
Caught up in a stream  
We were destined for each other  
From our very first hello  
We came bustin' through that river dam  
And made that river flow  
We will sail upon the ocean  
Til the shoreline meets the sky  
Carried on the first trade wind  
That favours you and I  
We have both of us between us  
Known misfortune in our days  
Darling this time, we're on our way  
  
'Cause we're here  
And here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
We are here  
And here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
  
Life, oh life is a chance  
We were the only two who spun the wheel  
And never scored romance  
If we'd stayed to play for fortune  
We'd have broke the banks of gold  
We'd have taken old Las Vegas  
For every cent that she could hold  
Love like ours was made in heaven  
It was blessed by Lord above  
We will spend our lives together  
Forever hand in glove  
We have both of us between us  
Known misfortune in our days  
Darling this time, we're on our way  
  
'Cause we're here  
And here we'll stay  
We won't ever throw this love of ours away  
We are here  
And here we'll stay  
We won't ever throw this love of ours away  
  
'Cause we're here  
And here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
We are here  
Here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
  
'Cause we're here  
And here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away  
So we are here  
And here we'll stay  
We will never throw this love of ours away...


So at last you're free  
It's the way you wanted it to be  
And the price you paid  
To become a woman of today  
Is it worth the pain to see the children cry  
Does it hurt when they ask for Daddy  
  
Hey hey Helen  
Now you live on your own  
Hey hey Helen  
Can you make it alone  
(Yes you can)  
  
So you're free at last  
And beginning to forget the past  
Does it make you sad  
When you think about the life you ha-ha-had  
But you're right, you had to take a second chance  
So you fight to find your freedom  
  
Hey hey Helen  
Now you live on your own  
Hey hey Helen  
Can you make it alone  
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)  
What's the matter with you  
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)  
Don't you know what to do  
(Yes you do)  
(Yes you do yes you do)  
(Yes you do yes you do)  
  
Hey hey Helen  
Now you live on your own  
Hey hey Helen  
Can you make it alone  
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)  
What's the matter with you  
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)  
Don't you know what to do  
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)  
Now you live on your own  
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)


You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues  
Sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes  
When it's bad, worse, worst  
(And when you're feeling so bad)  
And you think you're cursed  
(And you've got it sad)  
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose  
  
It's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
My friend Sam is a chauffeur, Annie goes to school  
Jerry works at the office, Sue lies by the pool  
But on all weekends  
(Together again)  
When I meet my friends  
(I'm gonna see them now)  
And we're lookin' round for the action we sure play it cool  
  
It's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
You paint your world and use all colors  
And then you find it all comes out too bright  
You know it's only a lie  
The songs you sing are too romantic  
And when you want the truth  
They only spit in your eye  
Oh yeah, they're only telling you lies  
Oh yeah, there's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues  
Sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes  
When it's bad, worse, worst  
(You know you're feeling so bad)  
And you think you're cursed  
(And you've got it sad)  
Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose  
  
It's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul  
There's gotta be rock'n roll  
To fill the hole in your soul


Honey honey, how you thrills me, ah-hah, honey honey  
Honey honey, nearly kill me, ah-hah, honey honey  
I'd heard about you before  
I wanted to know some more  
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine  
Oh, you make me dizzy  
  
Honey honey, let me feel it, ah-hah, honey honey  
Honey honey, don't conceal it, ah-hah, honey honey  
The way that you kiss goodnight (The way that you kiss me goodnight)  
The way that you hold me tight (The way that you're holding me tight)  
I feel like I want to sing when you do your thing  
  
I don't want to hurt you, baby, I don't want to see you cry  
So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high  
But I'm gonna stick to you, boy, you'll never get rid of me  
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be  
  
Honey honey, touch me, baby, ah-hah, honey honey  
Honey honey, hold me, baby, ah-hah, honey honey  
You look like a movie star (You look like a movie star)  
But I know just who you are (I know just who you are)  
And, honey, to say the least, you're a dog-gone beast  
  
So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high  
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be  
  
Honey honey, how you thrill me, ah-hah, honey honey  
Honey honey, nearly kill me, ah-hah, honey honey  
I heard about you before  
I wanted to know some more  
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine


I am just a girl  
One among the others, nothing much to say  
Plain and simple girl  
Not a special type in any way  
Just one look and you will surely see  
That the true Miss Nobody is me  
It's an evil world  
That has only made me a girl  
  
I am just a girl  
Not the kind of woman men would like to meet  
Just another girl  
No one ever looks at in the street  
But today I can't believe it's true  
When you smiled and whispered, I love you  
Darling I could see  
I was meant to be your girl  
  
It's a funny feeling when you get to love someone  
And thinking that he'll never look your way  
But then he says he loves you and life has just begun  
It's so much more than any words can say  
  
I am just a girl  
Not the kind of woman men would like to meet  
Just another girl  
No one ever looks at in the street  
But today I can't believe it's true  
When you smiled and whispered, I love you  
Darling I could see  
I was meant to be your girl  
  
La, la, la, la la  
  
But today I can't believe it's true  
When you smiled and whispered, I love you  
Darling I could see  
I was meant to be your girl


i am the city, you let me be  
i am the city  
  
Coming through a cloud you're looking at me from above  
And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes  
And you find me beautiful and irresistible  
A kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size  
And you feel a strange attraction  
The air is vibrant and electrified  
Welcome to me here I am, my arms are open wide  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
And a million voices blend into a single voice  
And you can hear it in the glamor of the crowded streets  
People come and take their chances  
Sometimes you win sometimes you lose a lot  
Come make your own contribution to this melting pot  
  
I'm the street you walk  
The language you talk  
I am the city  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
And the funny smells  
And the turmoil, the cars and the people  
The air that you're breathing is me  
Yes I am the city, you let me be  
  
People feed me with their lives I have a hungry soul  
And they all worship me and pay their homage day and night  
Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet  
But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light  
Dazzled by the crazy magic  
They're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf  
And in the wind if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh  
  
I'm the street you walk  
The language you talk  
I am the city  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
And the funny smells  
And the turmoil, the cars and the people  
The parks and the squares that you see  
All the sounds that you hear  
And the air that you're breathing is me  
Yes I am the city, you let me be  
  
I am the city  
You let me be  
I am the city  
  
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars  
And the funny smells  
And the turmoil the cars and the people  
The air that you're breathing is me  
  
Coming through a cloud  
You're looking at me from above  
And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes  
  
I'm the street you walk  
The language you talk  
I am the city  
Yes I am the city, you let me be  
  
And you find me beautiful and irresistible  
A kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size  
  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
You let me be  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
  
And a million voices blend into a single voice  
And you can hear it in the glamor of the crowded streets  
  
The skyline is me and the energy  
I am the city  
You let me be  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats  
  
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise  
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats


Love me or leave me  
Make your choice but believe me  
I love you  
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
I can't conceal it  
Don't you see?  
Can't you feel it?  
Don't you too?  
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
Oh, I've been dreaming through my lonely past  
Now I've just made it  
I found you at last  
So come on  
Now let's try it  
I love you  
Can't deny it  
'Cause it's true  
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
Oh, no hard feelings between you and me  
If we can't make it  
But just wait and see  
  
So come on now lets try it  
I love you, can't deny it  
'Cause it's true, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
So love me or leave me  
Make your choice but believe me  
I love you, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
I can't conceal it, don't you see?  
Can't you feel it?  
Don't you too? I do, I do, I do, I do, I do


I have a dream, a song to sing  
To help me cope with anything  
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale  
You can take the future even if you fail  
I believe in angels  
Something good in everything I see  
I believe in angels  
When I know the time is right for me  
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream  
  
I have a dream, a fantasy  
To help me through reality  
And my destination makes it worth the while  
Pushing through the darkness still another mile  
I believe in angels  
Something good in everything I see  
I believe in angels  
When I know the time is right for me  
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream  
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream  
  
I have a dream, a song to sing  
To help me cope with anything  
If you see the wonder of a fairy tale  
You can take the future even if you fail  
I believe in angels  
Something good in everything I see  
I believe in angels  
When I know the time is right for me  
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream  
I'll cross the stream, I have a dream


I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs  
No poet has ever painted  
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart  
So strange, yet we're so well acquainted  
I let the music speak with no restrains  
I let my feelings take over  
Carry my soul away, into the world  
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day  
  
Where my mind is like an open window  
Where the high and healing winds blow  
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me  
I let them take me  
  
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile  
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn  
Rustling down an old alley  
And in the dead of night, I find myself a blind man  
In some ancient valley  
I let the music speak, leading me gently  
Urging me like a lover  
Leading me all the way, into a place  
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day  
  
Where I'm one with every grand illusion  
No disturbance, no intrusion  
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me  
I let them use me  
  
Let it be a joke, let it be a smile  
Let it be a farce, if it makes me laugh for a little while  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Let it be a tear, let it be a sigh  
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry  
  
Let it be the joy of each new sunrise  
Or the moment when a day dies  
I surrender without reservation  
No explanation, no questions why  
I take it to me and let it flow through me  
Yes, I let the music speak  
I let the music speak


I saw it in the mirror  
I saw it in my face  
That I'm no longer needed  
Anyone can take my place  
I saw it in the mirror  
When I looked into my eyes  
'Cause something sure is wrong  
When this boy cries  
  
This boy cries  
  
I saw it in the mirror  
My head is hanging low  
And it ain't too familiar  
With the feelings that I show  
I know you say you love me  
But I'm looking through your lies  
It doesn't really bother you  
If this boy cries  
  
This boy cries  
  
I never thought I could cry for you  
But honey, I will miss you  
'Til the day I die  
'Til the day I die  
  
I saw it in the mirror  
I saw it in my face  
That I'm no longer needed  
Anyone can take my place  
I saw it in the mirror  
When I looked into my eyes  
'Cause something sure is wrong  
When this boy cries  
  
This boy cries  
This boy cries


This park and these houses, old streets I have walked  
Everything dear, will it be here  
One day when I am returning?  
My friends will get married, have children and homes  
It sounds so nice, well-planned and wise  
Never expecting surprises  
  
I wonder, it's frightening  
Leaving now, is that the right thing?  
I wonder, it scares me  
But who the the hell am I if I don't leave it  
I'm not a coward  
Oh no, I'll be strong  
One chance in a lifetime  
Yes I will take it, it can't go wrong  
  
My friends and my family, this dull little town  
Buses I've missed, boys that I've kissed  
Everything old and familiar  
  
I wonder, it's frightening  
Leaving now, is that the right thing?  
I wonder, it scares me  
But who the the hell am I if I don't leave it  
I'm not a coward  
Oh no, I'll be strong  
One chance in a lifetime  
Yes I will take it...  
Yes I will take it, it can't go wrong

I got appointments, work I have to do  
Keepin' me so busy all the day through  
They're the things that keep me from thinkin' of you  
Oh baby, I miss you so, I know I'm never gonna make it  
Oh, I'm so restless, I don't care what I say  
And I lose my temper ten times a day  
Still it's even worse when the night's on its way  
It's bad, oh, so bad  
  
Somehow I'd be doin' alright if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)  
I'd have courage left to fight if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall  
Sittin' here alone and starin' at the wall  
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights  
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)  
Somehow I'd be doin' alright if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
  
No-one to turn to, you know how it is  
I was not prepared for something like this  
Now I see them clearly, the things that I miss  
Oh baby, I feel so bad, I know I'm never gonna make it  
I got my business to help me through the day  
People I must write to, bills I must pay  
But everything's so different when night's on its way  
It's bad, oh, so bad  
  
Somehow I'd be doing alright if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)  
I'd have courage left to fight if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
How I fear the time when shadows start to fall  
Sittin' here alone and starin' at the wall  
Even I could see a light if it wasn't for the nights  
(Even I could see a light I think that I could make it)  
Guess my future would look bright if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)  
  
If it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could take it)  
if it wasn't for the nights  
(If it wasn't for the nights I think that I could make it)

You're so free  
That's what everybody's tellin' me  
Yet I feel like I'm an outward bound  
Pushed around refuge  
  
Something's wrong  
Got a feeling that I don't belong  
As if I have come from out of space  
Out of place, like King Kong  
  
I'm a marionette, just a marionette  
Pull the string  
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet  
Just as long as I sing  
  
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette  
'Round and 'round  
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette  
Just a silly old clown  
  
Like a doll  
Like a puppet with no will at all  
And somebody taught me how to talk  
How to walk, how to fall  
  
Can't complain  
I got no one but myself to blame  
Something's happening, I can't control  
Lost my hold, it's insane  
  
I'm a marionette, just a marionette  
Pull the string  
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet  
Just as long as I sing  
  
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette  
'Round and 'round  
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette  
Just a silly old clown  
  
Look this way  
Just a little smile is what they say  
You'll look better on the photograph  
If you laugh, that's o.k.!!  
  
I'm a marionette, just a marionette  
Pull the string  
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet  
Just as long as I sing  
  
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette  
'Round and 'round  
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette  
Just a silly old clown  
  
You're so free  
That's what everybody's tellin' me  
Yet I feel like I'm an outward bound  
Pushed around refugee


I, I've been in love before  
I thought I would no more  
Manage to hit the ceiling  
Still, strange as it seems to me  
You brought it back to me  
That old feeling  
  
I, I don't know what you do  
You make me think that you  
Possibly could release me  
I think you'll be able to  
Make all my dreams come true  
And you ease me  
  
You thrill me, you delight me  
You please me, you excite me  
You're something I'd been pleading for  
I love you, I adore you  
I lay my life before you  
I'll have you want me more and more  
And finally it seems my lonely days are through  
I've been waiting for you  
  
I, I'm gonna make you mine  
You're gonna feel so fine  
You'll never want to leave me  
I feel you belong to me  
Someday you will agree  
Please, believe me  
  
You thrill me, you delight me  
You please me, you excite me  
You're something I'd been pleading for  
I love you, I adore you  
I lay my life before you  
I'll have you want me more and more  
And finally it seems my lonely days are through  
I've been waiting for you  
Oh, I've been waiting for you


Super Trooper beams are gonna blind me  
But I won't feel blue  
Like I always do  
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you  
  
I was sick and tired of everything  
When I called you last night from Glasgow  
All I do is eat and sleep and sing  
Wishing every show was the last show  
(Wishing every show was the last show)  
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming  
(Glad to hear you're coming)  
Suddenly I feel all right  
(And suddenly it's gonna be)  
And it's gonna be so different  
When I'm on the stage tonight  
  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper lights are gonna find me  
Shining like the sun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Smiling, having fun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)Feeling like a number one  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper beams are gonna blind me  
But I won't feel blue  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Like I always do  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
  
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you  
  
Facing twenty thousand of your friends  
How can anyone be so lonely  
Part of a success that never ends  
Still I'm thinking about you only  
(Still I'm thinking about you only)  
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy  
(Think I'm going crazy)  
But it's gonna be alright  
(You'll soon be changing everything)  
Everything will be so different  
When I'm on the stage tonight  
  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper lights are gonna find me  
Shining like the sun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Smiling, having fun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Feeling like a number one  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper beams are gonna blind me  
But I won't feel blue  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)Like I always do  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you  
  
So I'll be there when you arrive  
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive  
And when you take me in your arms  
And hold me tight  
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight  
  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper lights are gonna find me  
Shining like the sun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Smiling, having fun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Feeling like a number one  
Tonight the  
Super Trooper beams are gonna blind me  
But I won't feel blue  
(Su-p-per Troo-p-per)  
Like I always do  
(Sup-p-per troop-p-per)  
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you  
Sup-p-per Troop-p-per lights are gonna find me  
Shining like the sun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Smiling, having fun  
(Sup-p-per Troop-p-per)  
Feeling like a number one


Just a notion that's all  
Just a feeling that you're watchin' me  
Every move I'm making  
Am I reading your mind  
Cause it's almost like you're touching me  
There is no mistaking  
Just a notion  
That you'll be walkin' up to me  
In a while  
And you smile and say hello  
Then we'll be dancing through the night  
Knowing everything from there on  
Must be right  
  
Just a notion  
But somehow I know I'm not wrong  
If it's our destiny there's nothing we can do  
But tonight is very special  
It's the night for me and you


Well I was looking at a movie on the TV last night  
Then I had a very funny notion, yeah  
I really had to write a song about it  
And then I'm gonna sing it with my rock 'n roll band  
And I bet the people gonna like it, yeah  
I know that everybody's gonna shout it  
  
And what a dreadful mighty killer  
A big black wide gorilla  
  
[Chorus:]  
We do the King Kong song, won't you sing along  
Listen to the music and it couldn't go wrong  
We do the Kong Kong song, gotta sing along  
Can't you hear the beating of the monkey tom-tom  
Listen to the rhythm of the King Kong song  
  
Now we can make the jungle out of any old place  
We can make gorillas out of people, yeah  
Well who can tell a monkey from a monkey?  
So people get together, gonna have a good time  
Everybody listen to the music, yeah  
'Cause what we're gonna sing is kinda funky  
  
So let your arms hang down  
And waddle all around  
Like a dreadful mighty killer  
A big black wide gorilla  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like a dreadful mighty killer  
A big black wide gorilla  
  
[Chorus: x2]


Lay your head on my chest so you hear every beat of my heart  
Now there's nothing at all that can keep us apart  
Touch my lips, close your eyes and see with your fingertips  
Things that you do, and you know I'm crazy 'bout you  
  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a landslide of emotions  
I've had my share of love affairs and they were nothing compared to this  
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
Kisses of fire  
Kisses of fire  
  
When you sleep by my side I feel safe and I know I belong  
Still it's making me scared that my love is so strong  
Losing you It's a nightmare, babe, and to me it's new  
Never before did you see me begging for more  
  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a landslide of emotions  
I've had my share of love affairs but they were nothing compared to this  
Oh, I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
Kisses of fire  
Kisses of fire  
  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a land-slide of emotions  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
(I'm at the point of no returning)  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
I'm riding higher than the sky and there is fire in every kiss  
(Caught in a land-slide of emotions)  
Kisses of fire, burning, burning  
I'm at the point of no returning  
Kisses of fire, sweet devotions  
Caught in a land-slide of emotions


No more carefree laughter  
Silence ever after  
Walking through an empty house, tears in my eyes  
Here is where the story ends, this is goodbye  
  
Knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)  
There is nothing we can do  
Knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)  
We just have to face it, this time we're through  
(This time we're through, this time we're through  
This time we're through, we're really through)  
Breaking up is never easy, i know but i have to go  
(I have to go this time  
I have to go, this time i know)  
Knowing me, knowing you  
It's the best i can do  
  
Mem'ries (mem'ries), good days (good days), bad days (bad days)  
They'll be (they'll be), with me (with me) always (always)  
In these old familiar rooms children would play  
Now there's only emptiness, nothing to say  
  
Knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)  
There is nothing we can do  
Knowing me, knowing you (ah-haa)  
We just have to face it, this time we're through  
(This time we're through, this time we're through  
This time we're through, we're really through)  
Breaking up is never easy, i know but i have to go  
(I have to go this time  
I have to go, this time i know)  
Knowing me, knowing you  
It's the best i can do


I wasn't jealous before we met  
Now every woman I see is a potential threat  
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice  
You've heard me saying that  
Smoking was my only vice  
But now it isn't true  
Now everything is new  
And all I've learned has overturned  
I beg of you  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
  
It was like shooting a sitting duck  
A little smalltalk, a smile  
And baby I was stuck  
I still don't know what  
You've done with me  
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily  
I feel a kind of fear  
When I don't have you near  
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride  
I beg you dear  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
Don't go sharing your devotion  
Lay all your love on me  
  
I've had a few little love affairs  
They didn't last very long and  
They've been pretty scarce  
I used to think that was sensible  
It makes the truth  
Even more incomprehensible  
'Cause everything is new  
And everything is you  
And all I've learned has overturned  
What can I do  
  
Don't go wasting your emotion  
Lay all your love on me  
Don't go sharing your devotion  
Lay all your love on me


Long awaited darkness falls  
Casting shadows on the walls  
In the twilight hour I am alone  
Sitting near the fireplace  
Dying embers warm my face  
In this peaceful solitude  
All the outside world subdued  
Everything comes back to me again  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
Half awake and half in dreams  
Seeing long forgotten scenes  
So the present runs into the past  
Now and then become entwined  
Playing games within my mind  
Like the embers as they die  
Love was one prolonged goodbye  
And it all comes back to me tonight  
In the gloom  
Like an angel passing through my room  
  
I close my eyes  
And my twilight images go by  
All too soon  
Like an angel passing through my room


Spring in the air  
The sun was shining  
Still the day was cool  
Saw her waiting for a bus  
As she was going home from school  
  
Looking so cold  
I took her home and  
That was just the start  
We would meet the summer through  
And she was always in my heart  
  
Love has it's ways  
Like seasons come and go  
And tomorrow there will be another day  
Love has it's ways  
And so before you know  
When you turn around it may have gone away  
  
Early that fall  
I knew I loved her  
More than anything  
Gave her everything I had  
She even got a wedding ring  
  
But in the end  
The mind was restless  
And she had to go  
And the love I'd thought would live  
Was buried in the winter snow  
  
Love has it's ways  
Like seasons come and go  
And tomorrow there will be another day  
Love has it's ways  
And so before you know  
When you turn around it may have gone away  
  
Love has it's ways  
Like seasons come and go  
And tomorrow there will be another day  
Love has it's ways  
And so before you know  
When you turn around it may have gone away


Do you remember the first time, and all of your sweet sweet talk  
Ain't heard it a lot since then love  
Now look at that guy, he's making me cry  
He leaves everybody and he only says goodbye  
But if I would have to choose I wouldn't let you go  
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow  
Darling I know  
  
We gotta have patience  
Love isn't just a sensation  
Some of the time it gets rough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Giving love is a reason for living  
But a few things can be tough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
  
From the first moment I saw you I've treated you like a queen  
I've given you lots of presents  
Now listen to that, just look at that cat  
You'd think he was an angel but he's talking through his hat  
But if I would have to choose I wouldn't let you go  
Just give it some more time and you will see our love will grow  
Darling I know  
  
We gotta have patience  
Love isn't just a sensation  
Some of the time it gets rough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Giving  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Love is a reason for living  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
But a few things can be tough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
  
Patience  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Love isn't just a sensation  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Some of the time it gets rough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Giving  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
Love is a reason for living  
(sweet sweet, our love is bitter-sweet)  
But a few things can be tough  
Love isn't easy but it sure is hard enough


I've always hated my room, it's so gloomy and dreary  
Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard  
So I can't understand how it's happened, how everything's changing  
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter  
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter  
  
You must have a lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
And I can feel your love anywhere (shining)  
Maybe even when you're not there (shining)  
The lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
You're shining like a star in the night (shining)  
I won't let you out of my sight (shining)  
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight  
  
How I remember the first time we went to movie  
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown  
And I waited there when you came up from behind and you kissed me  
And the traffic seemed to get a little lighter  
When you came into my life it all got so much brighter  
  
You must have a lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
And I can feel your love anywhere (shining)  
Maybe even when you're not there (shining)  
The lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
You're shining like a star in the night (shining)  
I won't let you out of my sight (shining)  
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight  
  
And I feel so good  
And I feel so right  
And I know that you must have a lovelight  
  
You've got lovelight  
And I can feel your love anywhere  
Maybe even when you're not there  
You've got lovelight  
Everything around you is lovelight  
You're shining like a star in the night (shining)  
I won't let you out of my sight (shining)  
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight  
  
Everything about you is right  
Let it glow and let it be bright  
I don't want to lose your lovelight  
Shining like a star in the night


Sit down and listen 'cause I've got good news for you  
It was in the papers today  
Some physician had made a discovery  
This' what she had to say:  
(oooh you know that)  
  
She said that every result she had backed her  
Claiming that love's a longevity factor  
  
So lovers live a little longer, baby  
You and me, we got a chance to live twice  
Lovers live a little longer, ain't that nice  
Lovers live a little longer, baby

Making love is a dynamite drug, baby  
So why don't we start right away  
(ahh, please don't wait)  
  
I don't care if they're watching 'cause listen  
We've got a reason for each time we're kissing

You and me, we got a chance to live twice  
Lovers live a little longer, ain't that nice  
Lovers live a little longer, baby

[Chorus]  
Mamma mia, here I go again  
My my, how can I resist you?  
Mamma mia, does it show again  
My my, just how much I've missed you?  
  
Yes, I've been brokenhearted  
Blue since the day we parted  
Why, why did I ever let you go?  
Mamma mia, now I really know  
My my, I could never let you go  
I've been angry and sad about things that you do  
I can't count all the times that I've told you "we're through"  
And when you go, when you slam the door  
I think you know that you won't be away too long  
You know that I'm not that strong  
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring  
One more look and I forget everything  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes, I've been brokenhearted  
Blue since the day we parted  
Why, why did I ever let you go?  
Mamma mia, even if I say  
"Bye bye, leave me now or never"  
Mamma mia, it's a game we play  
"Bye bye" doesn't mean forever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes, I've been brokenhearted  
Blue since the day we parted  
Why, why did I ever let you go?  
Mamma mia, now I really know  
My my, I could never let you go


Did you see that man in the limousine  
With the pretty doll, he is fifty and the girl's only seventeen  
But she doesn't care, and she never will  
If he's ninety-five she don't give a damn  
Just as long as he pays the bill  
  
Did you see that man with a fat cigar  
He just left his lunch with a belly full of lobster and caviar  
He can choose the wine from a vintage year  
He will drink champagne in his limousine  
Where the rest of the street can peer  
  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle  
Just like a spider in a cobweb  
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle  
He's never bothered by his conscience  
Deals with the Devil, 'cause he wants to be  
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle  
In the middle (in the middle, in the middle)  
  
But you see that man made a big mistake  
Even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake  
And the money too, all that he can spend  
He can buy the most, nearly anything  
But he can't buy the lot, his friend  
  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, never second fiddle  
Just like a spider in a cobweb  
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross  
'Cause he's the man in the middle, knows the way to diddle  
He's never bothered by his conscience  
Deals with the Devil, 'cause he wants to be  
Man in the middle, the middle, the middle  
In the middle (in the middle, in the middle)


Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Please take me back to that place  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
  
I remember all the games we used to play  
I really do  
And I went to see them almost everyday  
I wanted to  
Though we quarreled at times and had a few fights  
We were the best of friends  
We found a place in the sun  
A heaven of fun  
  
Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Wildest kids you could see  
We could play together, climbing the apple tree  
Yes, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Please take me back to that place  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
  
They would take me out for football games and such  
They liked to play  
And I guess I didn't like it very much  
But anyway  
I was happy and proud to be with the boys  
Being a little girl  
I found a place in the sun  
A heaven of fun  
  
Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Wildest kids you could see  
We could play together, climbing the apple tree  
Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Please take me back to that place  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
  
Well, there was me and Bobby and Bobby's brother  
Please take me back to that place  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
  
Got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
Got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
Got all my memories, those were my happiest days  
Where I've got all my memories, those were my happiest days


Sometimes when I'm mad  
There's a part of me that seems to be a little sad  
Sometimes when I scream  
There's a voice in me that says, "You shouldn't be so mean"  
Oh no, oh no  
Part of me is acting while the other stands beside  
Yes, I am to myself what Jekyll must have been to Hyde  
  
We're like sun and rainy weather  
Sometimes we're a hit together  
Me and I  
Gloomy moods and inspiration  
We're a funny combination  
Me and I  
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique  
Think about yourself for a minute  
And you'll find the answer in it  
Everyone's a freak  
  
Sometimes I have toyed  
With ideas that I got from good old Dr Freud  
Nothing new of course  
It may seem to you I try to break through open doors  
Oh no, oh no  
I just want to say a lot of that applies to me  
'Cause it's an explanation to my split identity  
  
We're like sun and rainy weather  
Sometimes we're a hit together  
Me and I  
Gloomy moods and inspiration  
We're a funny combination  
Me and I  
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique  
Think about yourself for a minute  
And you'll find the answer in it  
Everyone's a freak  
  
Me and I  
  
We're like sun and rainy weather  
Sometimes we're a hit together  
Me and I  
Gloomy moods and inspiration  
We're a funny combination  
Me and I  
I don't think I'm different or in any way unique  
Think about yourself for a minute  
And you'll find the answer in it  
Everyone's a freak  
  
We're like sun and rainy weather  
Sometimes we're a hit together  
Me and I  
Gloomy moods and inspiration  
We're a funny combination  
Me and I


I have tried in vain never had success  
So it seems my life is nothing but a mess  
I have lost my only friend  
Now it seems I have to start again  
  
Merry-go-round  
Where am I bound  
With my love and feelings  
Merry-go-round  
  
Who wants to kiss me  
And hug me and miss me  
Yes, who wants to do it  
I wish that I knew it  
  
Merry-go-round  
Wish I had found  
Somebody to care for  
Where am I bound  
  
Life is so lonely  
If life is just only  
To love with my loving  
Goes round and round  
  
Looking for someone  
Who would want to stay  
I might find her  
With a bit of luck one day  
  
But who knows  
So until then  
I can only try and try again  
  
Merry-go-round  
Where am I bound  
With my love and feelings  
Merry-go-round  
  
Who wants to kiss me  
And hug me and miss me  
Yes, who wants to do it  
I wish that I knew it  
  
Merry-go-round  
Wish I had found  
Somebody to care for  
Where am I bound  
  
Life is so lonely  
If life is just only  
To love with my loving  
Goes round and round  
  
Merry-go-round  
Where am I bound  
With my love and feelings  
Merry-go-round  
  
Who wants to kiss me  
And hug me and miss me  
Yes, who wants to do it  
I wish that I knew it  
  
Merry-go-round  
Wish I had found  
Somebody to care for  
Where am I bound  
  
Life is so lonely  
If life is just only  
To love with my loving  
Goes round and round


Well, you wake up in the morning  
Hear the ding-dong ring  
You go marching to the table  
See the same old thing  
See the fork on the table  
Nothing in your pan  
If you sing a thing about it  
You're in trouble with the man  
  
Let the midnight special shine a light on me  
Let the midnight special shine it's ever loving light on me  
  
If you ever go to houston  
Well, you better act right  
And you better not gamble  
And you better not fight  
For the sheriff will arrest you  
Then he'll take you down  
And before you understand it  
You are prison bound  
  
Let the midnight special  
Shine a light on me  
Let the midnight special  
Shine it's ever loving light on me  
On me, on me


I work all night, I work all day, to pay the bills I have to pay  
Ain't it sad  
And still there never seems to be a single penny left for me  
That's too bad  
In my dreams I have a plan  
If I got me a wealthy man  
I wouldn't have to work at all, I'd fool around and have a ball...  
  
Money, money, money  
Must be funny  
In the rich man's world  
Money, money, money  
Always sunny  
In the rich man's world  
Aha-ahaaa  
All the things I could do  
If I had a little money  
It's a rich man's world  
  
A man like that is hard to find but I can't get him off my mind  
Ain't it sad  
And if he happens to be free I bet he wouldn't fancy me  
That's too bad  
So I must leave, I'll have to go  
To Las Vegas or Monaco  
And win a fortune in a game, my life will never be the same...  
  
Money, money, money  
Must be funny  
In the rich man's world  
Money, money, money  
Always sunny  
In the rich man's world  
Aha-ahaaa  
All the things I could do  
If I had a little money  
It's a rich man's world  
  
Money, money, money  
Must be funny  
In the rich man's world  
Money, money, money  
Always sunny  
In the rich man's world  
Aha-ahaaa  
All the things I could do  
If I had a little money  
It's a rich man's world  
  
It's a rich man's world


They say a restless body can hide a peaceful soul.  
A voyager, ad a settler, they both have a distant goal.  
If I explore the heavens, or if I search inside.  
Well, it really doesn't matter as long as I can tell myself  
I've always tried.  
  
Like a roller in the ocean, life is motion  
Move on  
Like a wind that's always blowing, life is flowing  
Move on  
Like the sunrise in the morning, life is dawning  
Move on  
How I treasure every minute  
Being part of it, being in it  
With the urge to move on  
  
I've travelled every country, I've travelled in my mind  
It seems we're on a journey, a trip through space and time  
And somewhere lies the answer  
To all the questions why  
What really makes the difference  
Between all dead and living things, the will to stay alive  
  
Like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la)  
Life is motion (la la la la la la-la)  
Move on (la la la la-la)  
Like a wind that's always blowing (la la la la la la-la)  
Life is flowing (la la la la la la-la)  
Move on (la la la la-la)  
Like the sunrise in the morning (la la la la la la-la)  
Life is dawning (la la la la la la-la)  
Move on (la la la la-la)  
How I treasure every minute (la la la la)  
Being part of it (la la la la)  
Being in it (la la la la)  
With the urge to move on  
  
The morning breeze that ripples the surface of the sea  
The crying of the seagulls that hover over me  
I see it and I hear it  
But how can I explain  
The wonder of the moment  
To be alive, to feel the sun that follows every rain  
  
Like a roller in the ocean (la la la la la la-la)  
Life is motion (la la la la la la-la)  
Move on (la la la la-la)  
Like a wind that's always blowing (la la la la la la-la)  
Life is flowing (la la la la la la-la)  
Move on (la la la la-la)  
Like the sunrise in the morning (la la la la la la-la)  
Life is dawning (la la la la la la-la)  
Move on (la la la la-la)  
How I treasure every minute (la la la la)  
Being part of it (la la la la-ah)  
Being in it  
With the urge to move on  
  
La la la la la la-la, la la la la la la-la, la la la la-la  
Like a wind that's always blowing  
La la la la la la-la  
La la la la la la-la (life is flowing)  
La la la la-la (move on)  
Like the sunrise in the morning  
La la la la la la-la  
La la la la la la-la (life is dawning)  
La la la la-la (move on)  
How I treasure every minute (la la la la)  
Being part of it (la la la la-ah)  
Being in it  
With the urge to move on  
La la la la la la-la, la la la la la la-la, la la la la-la  
Like a wind that's always blowing...  


I've seen it on your face  
Tells me more than any worn out old phrase  
So now we'll go separate ways  
Never again we two  
Never again, nothing I can do  
  
Like an image passing by, my love, my life  
In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life  
I can see it all so clearly  
Answer me sincerely  
Was it a dream, a lie  
Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life  
Are the words you try to find, my love, my life  
But I know I don't posses you  
So go away, God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
Still my one and only  
  
I've watched you look away  
Tell me is it really so hard to say  
Oh, this has been my longest day  
Sitting here close to you  
Knowing that maybe tonight we're trough  
  
Like an image passing by, my love, my life  
In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life  
I can see it all so clearly  
Answer me sincerely  
Was it a dream, a lie  
Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life  
Are the words you try to find, my love, my life  
But I know I don't posses you  
So go away, God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
  
Yes, I know I don't posses you  
So go away, God bless you  
You are still my love and my life  
Still my one and only


Tried to sneak out without saying  
With my loudest record playing  
Ooh, my mama said, "Look at this, you haven't done your bed"  
My mama said, "That's a thing that you should do instead"  
  
Then I did what she had told me  
Dying for my friend to hold me  
Ooh, my mama said, "Try and get one thing into your head"  
My mama said, "Pa and me, we give you room and bed"  
How I want to live my life  
Want to live my life  
La-la-la, la-la-la, life  
  
In the morning she said "Listen"  
Ooh, I felt like in a prison  
Yeah, my mama said, "I know you've been out again with Fred"  
(My mama said)  
My mama said, "Don't you lie, your cheeks are blushing red"  
(My mama said)  
Oh I want to live my life  
Want to live my life  
La-la-la, la-la-la, life  
  
I said I can live without it  
How I wish you wouldn't doubt it  
Ooh, my mama said, "If you want to hurt me go ahead"  
(My mama said)  
My mama said, "I suppose you'd rather see me dead"  
(My mama said)  
Oh I want to live my life  
Want to live my life  
La-la-la, la-la-la, life [Repeat: x4]


Every day in the morning on her way to the office  
You can see as she catches a train  
Just a face among a million faces  
Just another woman with no name  
Not the girl you'd remember but she's still something special  
If you knew her I am sure you'd agree  
'Cause I know she's got a little secret  
Friday evening she turns out to be  
  
Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment she's waited for  
Just like Cinderella, just like Cinderella  
Nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way  
This is the part that she likes to play  
But she knows the fun would go away  
If she would play it every day  
  
So she's back every morning to her work at the office  
And another week to live in a dream  
And another row of early mornings  
In an almost never-ending stream  
Doesn't talk very often, kind of shy and uncertain  
Everybody seems to think she's a bore  
But they wouldn't know her little secret  
What her Friday night would have in store  
  
Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment she's waited for  
Just like Cinderella, just like Cinderella  
Nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way  
This is the part that she likes to play  
She would like to play it every day  
  
Nina, pretty ballerina, now she is the queen of the dancing floor  
This is the moment she's waited for  
Just like Cinderella, just like Cinderella  
Nina, pretty ballerina, who would ever think she could be this way  
This is the part that she likes to play


I was at a party  
And this feller said to me  
Something bad is happening  
I'm sure you do agree  
People care for nothing  
No respect for human rights  
Evil times are coming  
We are in for darker nights?  
I said who are you  
To talk about impending doom?  
He got kinda wary  
As he looked around the room  
He said, I'm a minister  
A big shot in the state?  
I said I just can't  
Believe it, boy  
I think it's great  
Brother can you tell me  
What is right and what is wrong?  
He said, keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone?  
  
On and on and on  
Keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone  
  
Over in the corner  
I could see this other guy  
He was kinda flirty  
He was giving me the eye  
So I took advantage  
Of the fact that I'm a star  
Shook my hair and took  
A casual stroll up to the bar  
And as sure as hell  
This guy was coming up to me  
He said, who am I and  
Who are you and who are we  
What's our situation do  
We have some time for us?  
I said, I was not exactly  
Waiting for the bus  
He said, if you're going  
Somewhere can I come along?  
I said, keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone?  
  
On and on and on  
Keep on rocking baby  
'Til the night is gone


No smiles, not a single word at the breakfast table  
Though I would have liked to begin  
So much that I want to say, but I feel unable  
You leave and you slam the door  
Like you've done many times before  
And I cry and I feel so helpless  
  
One man, one woman  
Two friends and two true lovers  
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
One man, one woman  
One life to live together  
One chance to take that never comes back again  
You and me 'till the end  
  
Outside I can see the sun trough the open window  
Inside everything feel so cold  
What's wrong, what is happening, where did all our love go  
Somethimes when I just can't cope  
I cling to a desperate hope  
And I cry and I feel like dying  
  
One man, one woman  
Two friends and two true lovers  
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
One man, one woman  
One life to live together  
One chance to take that never comes back again  
You and me 'till the end  
  
Daydreams of a better life, but I have to wake up  
The sound of a key in the door  
You smile and I realize that we need a shake up  
Our love is a precious thing  
Worth the pain and the suffering  
And it's never too late for changin'  
  
One man, one woman  
Two friends and two true lovers  
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times  
One man, one woman  
One life to live together  
One chance to take that never comes back again  
You and me 'till the end  
  
You and me till' the end


They passed me by, all of those great romances  
You were, I felt, robbing me of my rightful chances  
My picture clear, everything seemed so easy  
And so I dealt you the blow  
One of us had to go  
Now it's different, I want you to know  
  
One of us is crying  
One of us is lying  
In her lonely bed  
Staring at the ceiling  
Wishing she was somewhere else instead  
One of us is lonely  
One of us is only  
Waiting for a call  
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small  
Wishing she had never left at all  
  
I saw myself as a concealed attraction  
I felt you kept me away from the heat and the action  
Just like a child, stubborn and misconceiving  
That's how I started the show  
One of us had to go  
Now I've changed and I want you to know  
  
One of us is crying  
One of us is lying  
In her lonely bed  
Staring at the ceiling  
Wishing she was somewhere else instead  
One of us is lonely  
One of us is only  
Waiting for a call  
Sorry for herself, feeling stupid feeling small  
Wishing she had never left at all  
Never left at all  
  
Staring at the ceiling  
Wishing she was somewhere else instead  
One of us is lonely  
One of us is only  
Waiting for a call  


The summer air was soft and warm  
The feeling right, the Paris night  
Did it's best to please us  
And strolling down the Elysee  
We had a drink in each cafe  
And you  
You talked of politics, philosophy and I  
Smiled like Mona Lisa  
We had our chance  
It was a fine and true romance  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain  
Our last summer  
Memories that remain  
  
We made our way along the river  
And we sat down in the grass  
By the Eiffel tower  
I was so happy we had met  
It was the age of no regret  
Oh yes  
Those crazy years, that was the time  
Of the flower-power  
But underneath we had a fear of flying  
Of getting old, a fear of slowly dying  
We took the chance  
Like we were dancing our last dance  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame  
Our last summer  
Walking hand in hand  
  
Paris restaurants  
Our last summer  
Morning croissants  
Living for the day, worries far away  
Our last summer  
We could laugh and play  
  
And now you're working in a bank  
The family man, the football fan  
And your name is Harry  
How dull it seems  
Are you the hero of my dreams  
  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
Walks along the Seine, laughing in the rain  
Our last summer  
Memories that remain  
I can still recall our last summer  
I still see it all  
In the tourist jam, round the Notre Dame  
Our last summer  
Walking hand in hand  
Paris restaurants  
Our last summer  
Morning croissants  
Living for the day, worries far away...


People need hope, people need lovin'  
People need trust from a fellow man  
People nee love to make a good livin'  
People need faith in a helping hand  
  
Man has alway wanted a woman by his side  
To keep him company  
Women always knew that it takes a man to get  
Matrimony and harmony  
Everybody knows that a man who's feeling down  
Wants some female company  
Gotta have love to carry on living  
Gotta have love 'til eternity

Flowers in a desert need a drop of rain  
Like a woman needs a man  
If a man's in love and his woman wants the moon  
Then he'll take it down if he can  
Somebody who loves you and somebody who cares  
Isn't that what you call a friend  
Gotta have love to carry on living  
Isn't it easy to understand  
  
People need hope, people need lovin'  
People need trust from a fellow man  
People nee love to make a good livin'  
People need faith in a helping hand

Put on your white sombrero  
Saddle your horse my dear  
And ride off into the sunset  
You'd better go  
For there is no  
Place for you here  
Like and old fashioned hero  
You stand before me  
You think our life is a movie  
My world is real  
I live and feel  
And I can do without you  
Put on your white sombrero  
Your red bandana too  
Think of this day as a showdown  
Goodbye my friend  
This is the end  
For me and you  
Now be a bold vacquero  
Don't show your feelings  
I'll cry while you're disappearing  
Into the night  
All dressed in white  
Unchained and free without me  
Put on your white sombrero  
Like all the cowboys do  
Go find a sweet senorita  
Somebody meek  
Who'll never speak  
Harshly to you  
You're such a cavaliero  
Proud, never bending  
I want someone who will take me  
Just as I am  
I need a man  
Who is in rhyme  
With his time  
You'll never take me  
Just as I am  
I need a man  
Who is in rhyme  
With his time  


You can dance  
You can jive  
Having the time of your life  
See that girl  
Watch that scene  
Dig in the dancing queen  
  
Friday night and the lights are low  
Looking out for a place to go  
Where they play the right music  
Getting in the swing  
You come to look for a king  
Anybody could be that guy  
Night is young and the music's high  
With a bit of rock music  
Everything is fine  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the dancing queen  
Young and sweet  
Only seventeen  
Dancing queen  
Feel the beat from the tambourine  
You can dance  
You can jive  
Having the time of your life  
See that girl  
Watch that scene  
Dig in the dancing queen  
  
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on  
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone  
Looking out for another  
Anyone will do  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the dancing queen  
Young and sweet  
Only seventeen  
Dancing queen  
Feel the beat from the tambourine  
You can dance  
You can jive  
Having the time of your life  
See that girl  
Watch that scene  
Dig in the dancing queen, digging the dancing queen

I was sitting by the phone  
I was waiting all alone  
Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you  
It's a dark and dreary night  
Seems like nothing's going right  
Won't you tell me honey how can I go on here without you?  
  
Yes I'm down and feeling blue  
And I don't know what to do, oh-oh  
  
Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?  
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all  
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall  
And I sit all alone impatiently  
Won't you please understand the need in me  
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?  
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?  
  
You were here and now you're gone  
Hey did I do something wrong?  
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken  
Was it me or was it you?  
Tell me, are we really through?  
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking  
  
Please forgive and then forget  
Or maybe darling better yet, oh-oh  
  
Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

Oh-oh, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?  
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

Sitting in the darkest corner  
In the tender light I saw her face  
She was looking so sad and lonely  
Someone help me, someone save me  
I could see the look she gave me, oh  
Oh yeah, and there was one thing only  
That I knew I could do  
  
Let's go girl  
It's a beautiful place this world  
Come on baby let's dance  
To the rock'n'roll band  
Let's go now  
Let me show you that I know how  
Come on baby let's dance  
To the rock'n roll band  
Come on baby let's dance  
To the rock'n roll band  
You've been sitting there for hours  
Try to hide behind the flowers now  
Baby, we could have fun together  
Come on, cheer up, let's get started  
No use being broken-hearted now  
Oh yeah, you're gonna feel much better  
Yes I know that you will  
  
Let's go girl  
It's a beautiful place this world  
Come on baby let's dance  
To the rock'n roll band  
Let's go now

The poster on the wall of a dear friend  
I wish there was a way that I could show you how your songs set me free  
The hero of them all  
You're a legend  
I guess I'll never get a chance to know you  
Still you're close as can be  
  
Make the bandstand to a dreamland, Rubber Ball Man  
Clapping your hands, let your feet dance, Rubber Ball Man  
When you're jumping up and down, nobody's standing still  
Some of us dreaming, some of us screaming  
Look at your fans, how we love you, Rubber Ball Man!


Where are those happy days, they seem so hard to find  
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind  
Whatever happened to our love?  
I wish I understood  
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good  
  
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me  
S. O. S.  
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me  
S. O. S.  
When you're gone  
How can I even try to go on?  
When you're gone  
Though I try how can I carry on?  
  
You seem so far away though you are standing near  
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear  
I really tried to make it out  
I wish I understood  
What happened to our love, it used to be so good  
  
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me  
S. O. S.  
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me  
S. O. S.  
When you're gone  
How can I even try to go on?  
When you're gone  
Though I try how can I carry on?  
  
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me  
S. O. S.  
And the love you gave me, nothing else can save me  
S. O. S.  
When you're gone  
How can I even try to go on?  
When you're gone  
Though I try how can I carry on?  
When you're gone  
How can I even try to go on?  
When you're gone  
Though I try how can I carry on?


Frida  
He stands  
Towering over me beside my bed  
Losing his head  
  
Tells me  
I must take him seriously  
Droning on the usual way  
He's such a clever guy  
  
And I wonder  
Should I laugh or cry  
He's dressed  
In the striped pyjamas that I bought  
  
Trousers too short  
Gives me  
On his small philosophy  
Carries on the way he does  
  
And me I get so tired  
And I wonder  
Should I laugh or cry  
Agnetha, Frida  
  
High and mighty, his banner flies  
A fool's pride in his eyes  
Standing there on his toes  
To grow in size  
  
All I see is a big balloon  
Halfway up to the moon  
He's wrapped up in the warm  
And save cocoon  
  
Of an eternal lie  
So should I laugh or cry  
Frida  
Strange how  
  
Dangerously indifferent I have grown  
Cold as a stone  
No more  
Pain as there was pain before  
  
Far away he rambles on  
I feel my throat go dry  
And I wonder  
Should I laugh or cry  
  
Agnetha,  
Frida High and mighty, his banner flies  
A fool's pride in his eyes  
Standing there on his toes  
  
To grow in size  
All I see is a big balloon  
Halfway up to the moon  
He's wrapped up in the warm  
  
And save cocoon  
Of an eternal lie  
So should I laugh or cry


See me sitting in the palm tree  
Looking down at people passing by  
Sitting here no-one can harm me  
They just stare at me and wonder why  
No need to bother, I'm gonna stay up here  
Whatever happens, I won't let no-one near  
Until you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please  
You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now  
And in the evening, when the sun goes down  
I'll be the bluest of men in this town  
'Cause I love you, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
  
See me sitting in the palm tree  
Waiting for those little words from you  
People laugh and point their fingers  
Like I was a monkey at the zoo  
But I will stay here, among my coconuts  
So you will know dear, you're everything I've got  
Now won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
  
Winds blow, stars glow, I see a light in a window  
Dark trees, soft breeze, carry my message to her please  
  
See me sitting in the palm tree  
Feeling angry at the silly crowd  
No-one else but you can calm me  
You should know by now I'm far too proud  
I need to show you, I've got my feelings too  
You shouldn't treat me like you always do  
So won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please  
You really love me, Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine, yes you are now  
And in the evening, when the sun goes down  
I'll be the bluest of men in this town  
'Cause I love you, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
  
Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine  
Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine  
Jeanie Jeanie on my mind  
Jeanie Jeanie you're so fine


Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning  
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile  
I watch her go with a surge of that well known sadness  
And I have to sit down for a while  
The feeling that I'm losing her forever  
And without really entering her world  
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter  
That funny little girl  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
I try to capture every minute  
The feeling in it  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Do I really see what's in her mind  
Each time I think I'm close to knowing  
She keeps on growing  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
  
Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table  
Barely awake I let precious time go by  
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling  
And a sense of guilt I can't deny  
What happened to the wonderful adventures  
The places I had planned for us to go  
Well, some of that we did, but most we didn't  
And why, I just don't know  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
I try to capture every minute  
The feeling in it  
  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Do I really see what's in her mind  
Each time I think I'm close to knowing  
She keeps on growing  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
  
Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture  
And save it from the funny tricks of time  
(Slipping through my fingers)  
Slipping through my fingers all the time  
Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning  
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile


You think you're gonna make me sulk, you and your fancy car, ah-ha-ha  
But I can tell you honey your tricks ain't gonna get you far, ah-ha-ha  
They say that money's got a magic touch  
But not to me, it doesn't mean that much  
You won't have me tonight  
All right, all right, all right, all right  
  
So long, see you honey  
You can't buy me with your money  
Chasing, dazing, driving me crazy  
But I'll never be your girl  
So long, see you honey  
You can't buy me with your money  
You know it's not worth trying  
So long, so long, so long  
  
You didn't have to send me flowers like you did today, ah-ha-ha  
I wouldn't keep a thing from you, I gave them all away, ah-ha-ha  
The girls might fall for everything you've got  
But I'm not one of them, you know I'm not  
You won't have me tonight  
All right, all right, all right, all right  
  
So long, see you honey  
You can't buy me with your money  
Chasing, dazing, driving me crazy  
But I'll never be your girl  
So long, see you honey  
You can't buy me with your money  
You know it's not worth trying  
So long, so long, so long  
  
So long, see you honey  
You can't buy me with your money  
You know it's not worth trying  
So long, so long, so long  
So long, so long, so long  
So long, so long, so long


Do I hear what I think I'm hearing  
Do I see the signs I think I see  
Or is this just a fantasy  
Is it true that the beast is waking  
Stirring in his restless sleep tonight  
In the pale moonlight  
  
In the grip of this cold December  
You and I have reason to remember  
  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I don't sing  
They blow their horns and march along  
They drum their drums and look so strong  
You'd think that nothing in the world was wrong  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I won't sing  
Let's not look the other way  
Taking a chance  
Cause if the bugler starts to play  
We too must dance  
  
What's that sound, what's that dreadful rumble  
Won't somebody tell me what I hear  
In the distance, but drawing near  
Is it only a storm approaching  
All that thunder and the blinding light  
In the winter night  
  
In the grip of this cold December  
You and I have reason to remember  
  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I don't sing  
They blow their horns and march along  
They drum their drums and look so strong  
You'd think that nothing in the world was wrong  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I won't sing  
Let's not look the other way  
Taking a chance  
Cause if the bugler starts to play  
We too must dance  
  
Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing  
The songs that you and I won't sing  
Let's not look the other way  
Taking a chance  
Cause if the bugler starts to play  
We too must dance


And when I see the sign that points one way  
The lot we used to pass by every day  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same  
You're not to blame  
  
From deep inside the tears I forced to cry  
From deep inside the pain I chose to hide  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
Now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes  
For me it cries  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
Now as the rain beats down upon my weary eyes  
For me it cries  
  
Your name and mine inside a heart upon a wall  
Still find a way to haunt me  
Though they're so small  
  
Just walk away Renee  
You won't see me follow you back home  
The empty sidewalks on my block are not the same  
You're not to blame


Summer night city  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moonlight love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
In the sun I feel like sleeping  
I can't take it for too long  
My impatience slowly creeping  
Up my spine and going strong  
I know what's waiting there for me  
Tonight I'm loose and fancy free  
Ah-ah  
  
When the night comes with the action  
I just know it's time to go  
Can't resist the strange attraction  
From that giant dynamo  
Lots to take and lots to give  
Time to breathe and time to live  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moonlight love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
It's elusive call it glitter  
Somehow something turns me on  
Some folks only see the litter  
We don't miss them when they're gone  
I love the feeling in the air  
My kind of people everywhere  
Ah-ah  
  
When the night comes with the action  
I just know it's time to go  
Can't resist the strange attraction  
From this giant dynamo  
And tomorrow when it's dawning  
And the first birds starts to sing  
In the pale light of the morning  
Nothing's worth remembering  
  
It's a dream it's out of reach  
Scattered driftwood on the beach  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city  
  
Waiting for the sunrise soul dancing in the dark  
Summer night city  
Walking in the moon light love making in the park  
Summer night city


Suzy was nine and I was ten  
Right at the time when boys like to think they're men  
She used to follow us at school  
We really thought that she was a little fool  
And one day we said to her  
We don't want to hurt you girl  
But you'd better  
  
Look for a friend of your own, Suzy-hang-around  
Better come back when you're grown, Suzy-hang-around  
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure  
So get off our playground and stay away  
That's all that we've got to say  
Suzy-hang-around  
  
Suzy went home to Mama's arms  
Mama said "Look, she's never done you no harm  
So get off her back and let her be  
Why can't you play together in harmony?"  
We really didn't know what to say  
But as soon as she went away  
We laughed and said  
  
Look for a friend of your own, Suzy-hang-around  
Better come back when you're grown, Suzy-hang-around  
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure  
So get off our playground and stay away  
That's all that we've got to say  
Suzy-hang-around  
  
Yes you'd better  
Look for a friend of your own, Suzy-hang-around  
Better come back when you're grown, Suzy-hang-around  
Nobody wants you around here and that's for sure  
So get off our playground and stay away  
That's all that we've got to say  
Suzy-hang-around

If you change your mind, I'm the first in line  
Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me  
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around  
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down  
If you're all alone when the pretty birds have flown  
Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me  
Gonna do my very best and it ain't no lie  
If you put me to the test, if you let me try  
  
Take a chance on me  
(That's all I ask of you honey)  
Take a chance on me  
  
We can go dancing, we can go walking, as long as we're together  
Listen to some music, maybe just talking, get to know you better  
'Cos you know I've got  
So much that I wanna do, when I dream I'm alone with you  
It's magic  
You want me to leave it there, afraid of a love affair  
But I think you know  
That I can't let go  
  
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line

Take a chance on me  
(Come on, give me a break will you?)  
Take a chance on me  
  
Oh you can take your time baby, I'm in no hurry, know I'm gonna get you  
You don't wanna hurt me, baby don't worry, I ain't gonna let you  
Let me tell you now  
My love is strong enough to last when things are rough  
It's magic  
You say that I waste my time but I can't get you off my mind  
No I can't let go  
'Cos I love you so  
  
If you change your mind, I'm the first in line  
Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me  
If you need me, let me know, gonna be around  
If you've got no place to go, if you're feeling down

Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me  
Gonna do my very best, baby can't you see  
Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me  
(Take a chance, take a chance, take a chance on me)  
  
Ba ba ba ba baa, ba ba ba ba baa  
Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me  
Gonna do my very best, baby can't you see  
Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me

Ba ba ba ba baa, ba ba ba ba baa ba-ba  
Honey I'm still free  
Take a chance on me  


I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore  
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before  
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing  
Cause everyone listens when I start to sing  
I'm so grateful and proud  
All I want is to sing it out loud  
  
So I say  
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing  
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty  
What would life be?  
Without a song or a dance what are we?  
So I say thank you for the music  
For giving it to me  
  
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk  
She says I began to sing long before I could talk  
But I've often wondered, how did it all start?  
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart  
Like a melody can?  
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan  
  
So I say  
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing  
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty  
What would life be?  
Without a song or a dance what are we?  
So I say thank you for the music  
For giving it to me  
  
I've been so lucky, I am the girl with golden hair  
I wanna sing it out to everybody  
What a joy, what a life, what a chance!  
  
So I say  
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing  
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing  
Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty  
What would life be?  
Without a song or a dance what are we?  
So I say thank you for the music  
For giving it to me


Are you sure you want to hear more  
What if I ain't worth the while  
Not the style you'd be looking for  
If I'm sweet tonight  
Things look different in the morning light  
I'm jealous and I'm proud  
If you hurt my feelings I'll cry out loud  
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
That's me  
  
Are you sure you want to hear more  
Would I be the one you seek  
Mild and meek like the girl next door  
Don't you realize  
I may be an angel in disguise  
It's lonely to be free  
But I'm not a man's toy, I'll never be  
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
That's me  
  
I don't believe in fairy-tales  
Sweet nothings in my ear  
But I do believe in sympathy  
That's me, you see  
  
Are you sure you want to hear more  
Won't you have a drink with me  
Just to see you're not really sore  
I can't help my ways  
I'm just not the girl to hide my face  
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
That's me  
  
There's a special love  
Like an eagle flying with a dove  
I'll find it in the end  
If I keep on searching, but until then  
I'm Carrie not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry  
That's me


I must have left my house at eight, because I always do  
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due  
I must have read the morning paper going into town  
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned  
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine  
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed  
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so  
The usual place, the usual bunch  
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained  
The day before you came  
  
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two  
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue  
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day  
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away  
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule  
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school  
The train back home again  
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then  
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within its usual frame  
The day before you came  
  
I must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so  
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go  
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV  
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see  
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten  
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then  
I must have read a while  
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style  
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim  
The day before you came  
  
And turning out the light  
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night  
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain  
The day before you came


I believe your new girl turned you down  
And they say she's pushin' you around  
How does it feel, I guess it hurts your pride  
Tell me my friend how many nights you've cried  
  
Disaster and disgrace  
The king has lost his crown  
Suddenly  
He's clumsy like a clown  
The world is upside down  
The king has lost his crown  
  
Was it hard to step down from your throne  
And to know tonight you're all alone  
Oh what a shame, you really want that girl  
She doesn't care, still you just dream of her  
  
Disaster and disgrace  
The king has lost his crown  
Suddenly  
He's clumsy like a clown  
The world is upside down  
The king has lost his crown  
  
Disaster and disgrace  
The word is all around  
Suddenly  
He's clumsy like a clown  
The world is upside down  
The king has lost his crown


I've seen you twice, in a short time  
Only a week since we started  
It seems to me, for every time  
I'm getting more open-hearted  
  
I was an impossible case  
No-one ever could reach me  
But I think I can see in your face  
There's a lot you can teach me  
So I wanna know  
  
What's the name of the game?  
Does it mean anything to you?  
What's the name of the game?  
Can you feel it the way I do?  
Tell me please, 'cause I have to know  
I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow  
  
And you make me talk  
And you make me feel  
And you make me show  
What I'm trying to conceal  
If I trust in you, would you let me down?  
Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?  
Could you feel the same way too?  
I wanna know  
  
The name of the game  
  
I have no friends, no-one to see  
And I am never invited  
Now I am here, talking to you  
No wonder I get excited  
  
Your smile, and the sound of your voice  
And the way you see through me  
Got a feeling, you give me no choice  
But it means a lot to me  
So I wanna know  
  
What's the name of the game? (Your smile and the sound of your voice)  
Does it mean anything to you? (Got a feeling you give me no choice)  
(But it means a lot)  
What's the name of the game? (Your smile and the sound of your voice)  
Can you feel it the way I do?  
Tell me please, 'cause I have to know  
I'm a bashful child, beginning to grow  
  
And you make me talk  
And you make me feel  
And you make me show  
What I'm trying to conceal  
If I trust in you, would you let me down?  
Would you laugh at me, if I said I care for you?  
Could you feel the same way too?  
I wanna know  
Oh yes I wanna know  
  
The name of the game (I was an impossible case)  
Does it mean anything to you? (But I think I can see in your face)  
(That it means a lot)  
What's the name of the game? (Your smile and the sound of your voice)  
Can you feel it the way I do? (Got a feeling you give me no choice)

They came from the hills  
And they came from the valleys and the plains  
They struggled in the cold  
In the heat and the snow and in the rain  
Came to hear him play  
Play their minds away  
  
We're all following a strange melody  
We're all summoned by a tune  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon for him  
And we dance beneath the moon  
Sub luna saltamus  
  
They came from the south  
From the west and the north and from the east  
They waited for the man  
Like a parish is waiting for the priest  
Longed to hear him play  
Play their minds away  
  
We're all following a strange melody  
We're all summoned by a tune  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon for him  
And we dance beneath the moon  
Sub luna saltamus  
  
He gave them a dream  
He seduced everybody in the land  
The fire in his eyes  
And the fear was a weapon in his hand  
So they let him play  
Play their minds away  
  
We're all following a strange melody  
We're all summoned by a tune  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon  
We're following the piper  
And we dance beneath the moon for him  
And we dance beneath the moon  
  
And we dance beneath the moon


I hear the doorbell ring and suddenly the panic takes me  
The sound so ominously tearing through the silence  
I cannot move, I'm standing  
Numb and frozen  
Among the things I love so dearly  
The books, the paintings and the furniture  
Help me  
  
The signal's sounding once again and someone tries the door-knob  
None of my friends would be so stupidly impatient  
And they don't dare to come here  
Anymore now  
But how I loved our secret meetings  
We talked and talked in quiet voices  
Smiling  
  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel I'm  
Crackin' up  
Voices growing louder, irritation building  
And I'm close to fainting  
Crackin' up  
They must know by now I'm in here trembling  
In a terror evergrowing  
Crackin' up  
My whole world is falling, going crazy  
There is no escaping now, I'm  
Crackin' up  
  
These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation  
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces  
And now they've come to take me  
Come to break me  
And yet it isn't unexpected  
I have been waiting for these visitors  
Help me  
  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel I'm  
Crackin' up  
Voices growing louder, irritation building  
And I'm close to fainting  
Crackin' up  
They must know by now I'm in here trembling  
In a terror evergrowing  
Crackin' up  
My whole world is falling, going crazy  
There is no escaping now, I'm  
Crackin' up  
  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel I'm  
Crackin' up  
Voices growing louder, irritation building  
And I'm close to fainting  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
They must know by now I'm in here trembling  
In a terror evergrowing  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
My whole world is falling, going crazy  
There is no escaping now, I'm  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
Now I hear them moving  
Muffled noises coming through the door  
I feel I'm  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
Voices growing louder, irritation building  
And I'm close to fainting  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
They must know by now I'm in here trembling  
In a terror ever growing  
  
Crackin' up (I have been waiting for these visitors)  
My whole world is falling, going crazy  
There is no escaping now, I'm  
Crackin' up


You and I can share the silence  
Finding comfort together  
The way old friends do  
  
And after fights and words of violence  
We make up with each other  
The way old friends do  
  
Times of joy and times of sorrow  
We will always see it through  
Oh, I don't care what comes tomorrow  
We can face it together  
The way old friends do  
  
You and I can share the silence  
Finding comfort together  
The way old friends do  
  
And after fights and words of violence  
We make up with each other  
The way old friends do  
  
Times of joy and times of sorrow  
We will always see it through  
Oh I don't care what comes tomorrow  
We can face it together  
The way old friends do  
  
We can face it together  
The way old friends do


I don't want to talk  
About the things we've gone through  
Though it's hurting me  
Now it's history  
I've played all my cards  
And that's what you've done too  
Nothing more to say  
No more ace to play  
  
The winner takes it all  
The loser standing small  
Beside the victory  
That's my destiny  
  
I was in your arms  
Thinking I belonged there  
I figured it made sense  
Building me a fence  
Building me a home  
Thinking I'd be strong there  
But I was a fool  
Playing by the rules  
  
The gods may throw a dice  
Their minds as cold as ice  
And someone way down here  
Loses someone dear  
The winner takes it all  
The loser has to fall  
It's simple and it's plain  
Why should I complain.  
  
But tell me does she kiss  
Like I used to kiss you?  
Does it feel the same  
When she calls your name?  
Somewhere deep inside  
You must know I miss you  
But what can I say  
Rules must be obeyed  
  
The judges will decide  
The likes of me abide  
Spectators of the show  
Always staying low  
The game is on again  
A lover or a friend  
A big thing or a small  
The winner takes it all  
  
I don't want to talk  
If it makes you feel sad  
And I understand  
You've come to shake my hand  
I apologize  
If it makes you feel bad  
Seeing me so tense  
No self-confidence  
But you see  
The winner takes it all  
The winner takes it all


The city is a jungle, you better take care  
Never walk alone after midnight  
If you don't believe it you better beware  
Of me  
  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
  
The city is a nightmare, a horrible dream  
Some of us will dream it forever  
Look around the corner and try not to scream  
It's me  
  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
  
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights  
Yellow eyes, the spotlight of the city nights  
  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
  
The city is a prison, you never escape  
You're forever trapped in the alleys  
Look into the shadows and you'll see the shape  
Of me  
  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights  
Yellow eyes, the spotlight of the city nights  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
People who fear me never go near me, I am the tiger  
And if I meet you, what if I eat you, I am the tiger  
I am behind you, I'll always find you, I am the tiger  
Tiger  
Tiger  
Tiger


Come to my loveland, wander along  
Beautiful gardens full of flowers and songs  
Come to the sunshine, beaches and sand  
Here's the two bluebirds, won't you come to my land  
  
The grass is mellow and the sky is blue  
My paradise is waiting here for you  
  
Oh, it's a tropical loveland  
Oh, I want to share it with you  
Life can be funny  
Happy and sunny

Over the rainbow, under the moon  
That's where my land is, won't you come to me soon?  
  
Just take my hand, I'll show you everything  
The secrets that my paradise can bring

Oh, I want to share it with you  
Life can be funny  
Happy and sunny  
Oh, in my tropical loveland  
  
Oh, it's a tropical loveland  
Oh, I want to share it with you  
(I want to share it with you)  
Oh, it's a tropical loveland  
(It's a tropical loveland)  
Oh, I want to share it with you  
Oh, it's a tropical loveland  
Oh, I want to share it with you


He had what you might call a trivial occupation  
He cleaned the platforms of the local railway station  
With no romance in his life  
Sometimes he wished he had a wife  
He read the matrimonial advertising pages  
The cries for help from different people, different ages  
But they had nothing to say  
At least not until the day  
When something special he read  
This is what it said  
  
If you dream of the girl for you  
Then call us and get two for the price of one  
We're the answer if you feel blue  
So call us and get two for the price of one  
If you dream of the girl for you  
Then call us and get two for the price of one  
We're the answer if you feel blue  
So call us and get two for the price of one  
  
He called the number and a voice said: "Alice Whiting"  
The voice was husky and it sounded quite exciting  
He was amazed at his luck  
The purest streak of gold he'd struck  
He said: "I read your ad, it sounded rather thrilling  
I think a meeting could be mutually fulfilling  
Why don't we meet for a chat  
The three of us in my flat"  
I can't forget what I read  
This is what it said  
  
If you dream of the girl for you  
Then call us and get two for the price of one  
We're the answer if you feel blue  
So call us and get two for the price of one  
If you dream of the girl for you  
Then call us and get two for the price of one  
We're the answer if you feel blue  
So call us and get two for the price of one  
  
She said: "I'm sure we must be perfect for each other  
And if you doubt it, you'll be certain when you meet my mother"


Don't know how to take it, don't know where to go  
My resistance running low  
And every day the hold is getting tighter and it troubles me so  
(You know that I'm nobody's fool)  
I'm nobody's fool and yet it's clear to me  
I don't have a strategy  
It's just like taking candy from a baby and I think I must be  
  
Under attack, I'm being taken  
About to crack, defenses breaking  
Won't somebody please have a heart  
Come and rescue now 'cause I'm falling apart  
Under attack, I'm taking cover  
He's on my track, my chasing lover  
Thinking nothing can stop him now  
But I want to know, should I want to, I'm not sure  
  
This is getting crazy, I should tell him so  
Really let my anger show  
Persuade him that the answer to his questions is a definite "no"  
(I'm kind of certain that's the truth)  
Guess I'm kind of flattered but I'm scared as well  
Something like a magic spell  
I hardly dare to think of what could happen, where I'd be if I fell  
  
Under attack, I'm being taken  
About to crack, defenses breaking  
Won't somebody please have a heart  
Come and rescue now 'cause I'm falling apart  
Under attack, I'm taking cover  
He's on my track, my chasing lover  
Thinking nothing can stop him now  
Should I want to, I'm not sure, I would know how

People everywhere  
A sense of expectation hanging in the air  
Giving out a spark  
Across the room your eyes are glowing in the dark  
And here we go again, we know the start, we know the end

"The girl means business so I'll offer her a drink"  
Looking mighty proud  
I see you leave your table, pushing through the crowd

Master of the scene  
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more

You move like a flame of fire  
Your eyes like a flash of lightning  
You lie since you're cold inside  
And I'm gonna tame you, wild thing  
You'd better watch out  
I said you'd better watch out  
Watch out  
Anywhere you go I'll find you  
Watch out  
I'll be staying close behind you  
And I've tired of waiting (Oh-a-la-la)  
Yes it's driving me crazy (Oh-a-la-la-la)  
And my patience is fading (Oh-a-la-la)  
Oh, you'd better watch out  
I said you'd better watch out  
  
You speak and you're funny lately  
You act like I was a stranger  
I think you're beginning to hate me  
But then you're a girl in danger  
  
You'd better watch out  
Ooh, I said you'd better watch out  
Watch out  
Anywhere you go I'll find you  
Watch out  
I'll be staying close behind you  
And I've tired of waiting (Oh-a-la-la)  
Yes it's driving me crazy (Oh-a-la-la-la)  
And my patience is fading (Oh-a-la-la)  
So you'd better watch out  
Yes I said you'd better watch out  
Watch out  
Watch out  
  
And I've tired of waiting (Oh-a-la-la)  
Yes it's driving me crazy (Oh-a-la-la-la)  
And my patience is fading (Oh-a-la-la)  
I said you'd better watch out  
Oh girl you'd better watch out  
Ah, you'd better watch out  
Oh, ah, you'd better watch out


My my  
At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender  
Oh yeah  
And I have met my destiny in quite a similiar way  
The history book on the shelf  
Is always repeating itself  
Waterloo - I was defeated, you won the war  
Waterloo - Promise to love you for ever more  
Waterloo - Couldn't escape if I wanted to  
Waterloo - Knowing my fate is to be with you  
Waterloo - Finally facing my Waterloo  
  
My my  
I tried to hold you back, but you were stronger  
Oh yeah  
And now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight  
And how could I ever refuse  
I feel like I win when I lose  
Waterloo - I was defeated, you won the war  
Waterloo - Promise to love you for ever more  
Waterloo - Couldn't escape if I wanted to  
Waterloo - Knowing my fate is to be with you  
Waterloo - Finally facing my Waterloo

Went to buy me a paper at the local news-stand  
And then I heard them laugh and say  
Look, they're gonna go flying way up to the moon now  
Hey, what's it good for anyway?  
So I said  
Fellas, like to ask you a thing if I may  
  
What about Livingstone?  
What about all those men?  
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while  
Traveling up the Nile  
Putting themselves on test  
Didn't that help the rest?  
Wasn't it worth it then?  
What about Livingstone?  
  
And all of those fellas at the local news-stand  
Didn't know what to answer or what to say  
So I told them about him, that he was just like  
One of those spacemen in his way  
And if you laugh at them  
Then there's only a thing I can say  
  
What about Livingstone?  
What about all those men?  
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while  
Traveling up the Nile  
Putting themselves on test  
Didn't that help the rest?  
Wasn't it worth it then?  
  
What about Livingstone?  
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)  
What about all those men?  
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)  
Who have sacrificed their lives to lead the way  
Tell me, wasn't it worth the while  
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)  
Traveling up the Nile  
(Didn't he do it?)  
Putting themselves on test  
Didn't that help the rest?  
(Didn't that help them? Well, didn't it?)  
Wasn't it worth it then?  
What about Livingstone?  
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)  
What about all those men?  
(Didn't he do it, well didn't he?)


Here's to us one more toast and then we'll pay the bill  
Deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill  
Birds of passage, you and me  
We fly instinctively  
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun  
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done  
  
In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks  
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex  
We're still striving for the sky  
No taste for humble pie  
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun  
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done  
  
It's so strange when you're down and lying on the floor  
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more  
Clear-headed and open-eyed  
With nothing left untried  
Standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run  
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done  
  
Standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run  
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done


Everybody screamed when I kissed the teacher  
And they must have thought they dreamed when I kissed the teacher  
All my friends at school  
They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool  
Nearly petrified 'cause he was taken by surprise  
When I kissed the teacher  
Couldn't quite believe his eyes, when I kissed the teacher  
My whole class went wild  
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled  
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher  
  
One of these days  
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night  
One of these days  
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright  
  
I was in a trance when I kissed the teacher  
Suddenly I took the chance when I kissed the teacher  
Leaning over me, he was trying to explain the laws of geometry  
And I couldn't help it, I just had to kiss the teacher  
  
One of these days  
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night  
One of these days  
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright  
  
What a crazy day, when I kissed the teacher  
All my sense had flown away when I kissed the teacher  
My whole class went wild  
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled  
I was in the seventh heaven when I kissed the teacher  
(I want to hug, hug, hug him)  
When I kissed the teacher  
(I want to hug, hug him)  
When I kissed the teacher  
(I want to hug, hug, hug him)  
When I kissed the teacher  
(I want to hug, hug him)  
When I kissed the teacher  
(I want to hug, hug, hug him)


When you were lonely, you needed a man  
Someone to lean on, well I understand  
It's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
Nights can be empty, nights can be cold  
So you were looking for someone to hold  
That's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
  
I was so lonesome, I was blue  
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I  
Always thought you knew the reason why  
I only wanted a little love affair  
Now I can see you are beginning to care  
But baby, believe me  
It's better to forget me  
  
Men are toys in the game that you play  
When you get tired, you throw them away  
That's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
Falling in love with a woman like you  
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do  
It's only natural  
But why did it have to be me?  
  
I was so lonesome, I was blue  
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I  
Always thought you knew the reason why  
I only wanted a little love affair  
Now I can see you are beginning to care  
But baby, believe me  
It's better to forget me.


Frida Now there's a shadow falling over our faces  
Doubt forever in our hearts  
And in a while we'll start to pick up the traces  
We won't find the missing parts  
  
Buy me a ticket, I'll go to the Bahamas  
I need a rest from our petty little dramas  
Yes I really do  
Agnetha, Frida Aha, mm  
  
Now look what you've done  
I'm missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
  
It's my turn to run  
A chance to feel the sun  
Baby you owe me one  
Frida I wasn't ready for this kind of intrusion  
  
I was taken by surprise  
Now both of us are in a state of confusion  
Hesitation in our eyes  
Something unwanted has entered our existence  
  
I think it's better to view it from a distance  
Yes I really do  
Agnetha, Frida Aha, mm  
Now look what you've done  
  
I'm missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
It's my turn to run  
  
A chance to feel the sun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
Now look what you've done  
  
I'm missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
It's my turn to run  
  
A chance to feel the sun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
Now look what you've done  
  
I'm missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
It's my turn to run  
  
A chance to feel the sun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
Now look what you've done  
  
I'm missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
It's my turn to run  
  
A chance to feel the sun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha, mm  
Now look what you've done  
  
I'm missing all the fun  
Baby you owe me one  
Aha


Always have, always will  
I was mesmerized when I first met you  
Wouldn't let myself believe  
That you could step right out of my wildest dreams  
But you didn't know  
That secret part of me  
Until we kissed an made it open up so easily  
  
I always have  
Even when it didn't show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you  
Whenever you're close to me  
I always have  
Doesn't matter where we go  
I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
Always have, always will  
  
Everything that you give in to  
Everything you'll ever need  
Is locked up somewhere deep inside of me  
You gotta know  
But more importantly  
You've got to stay and hold me while we live this fantasy  
  
I always have  
Even when it didn't show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you  
Whenever you're close to me  
I always have  
Doesn't matter where we go  
I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
  
Sometimes we try too hard to please  
We should let love come naturally  
And sometimes I don't know  
Just what you really do to me  
That is O.K.  
'cause it's all part of the mystery  
  
I always have  
Even when it didn't show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you  
Whenever you're close to me  
I always have  
Doesn't matter where we go  
I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
Always have, always will  
  
I always have  
Even when it didn't show  
I always will  
You know that I just want to touch you  
Whenever you're close to me  
I always have  
Doesn't matter where we go  
I always will  
You know that I just want to show you  
Just how much you mean to me  
Always have, always will


This is a song about a well-known girl  
Who was she?  
  
We will never know the answer to that question  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
According to a well-known song  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
Simon and garfunkel had a little problem  
It was something about their hearts, you used to break  
Them, and make them go down on their knees  
On and on again  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
According to a well-known song  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
Romeo and Juliet had another story, but they  
Were a single pair, not free like you  
Still they got a tragical end  
So many years ago, life in itself can't hurt  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
Passion changes but they will still remember you  
I say they loved you and they would do the same for you today  
  
We'll never know the answer to that question  
  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, you're gonna live forever  
According to a well known song  
Cecilia, walk in the light  
Cecilia, did you come home and to whom?  
  
I've been trying to overcome the mental blocks I've got  
If they loved you, why didn't you respond to all their please?  
I wonder  
I wonder

Fire! I can see it burning so brightly  
Fire! I can feel it calling out to me  
And as the sun goes down  
It starts to paint a picture  
  
Of an ancient town  
So far away, across the endless sea  
Lead me to the light  
And take me to the edge of heaven  
  
I'm standing in the night  
Looking for the edge of heaven  
We'll be touching the edge of heaven  
Time  
  
Close your eyes see dreams of tomorrow  
Time  
The wheels are turning till eternity  
And as the darkness comes  
  
I start to see a picture  
Of a lonely man  
So clearly now reaching out for me  
Lead me to the light  
  
And sail the endless sea  
So lead me to the light  
And take me to the edge of heaven  
The edge of heaven is near  
  
We'll sail the endless sea

Hey darling  
Have to tell 'bout the world  
Have to tell you today  
Believe me now  
Believe me now  
You'd better believe in angels  
There's no other substitute  
We all do that before we're going up in the sky  
If your loving is in your money  
Know they cannot hug you back  
This is the sound of the world  
I know, I say, I do, I say  
Hey darling  
Have I told you 'bout the rest of the world  
Hey darling  
Why don't you see  
You gonna twist and curl  
Take a look around  
Take a look around  
You're going to be burned out  
You must blame it on yourself  
You're burning your candlse both ways  
That I've learned from my past  
Quench your thirst with memories  
There's no point in being stressed  
That is the thing I have learned  
I've done, I've been, I've seen all that  
Hey darling  
Have I told you 'bout the rest of the world  
Hey darling  
Why don't you see  
You gonna twist and curl  
Take a look around  
Hey darling  
Have I told you 'bout the rest of the world  
Take a look around  
Hey darling (ouuh, ooooooh)  
Have I told you 'bout the rest of the world (Got to tell you ...)  
I'm never gonna change my mind  
No, I'm never gonna change my mind  
Believe me now  
Believe me now  
Hey darling  
Have I told you 'bout the rest of the world  
Hey darling  
Why don't you see  
You gonna twist and curl (Got to tell you ...)  
Hey darling  
Hey darling (have to tell you today)  
Hey darling (ah uh)  
Hey darling (have to tell you ...)

We live in a free world  
I whistle down the wind  
Carry on smiling  
And the world will smile with you  
"Life is a flower  
So precious in your hand  
Carry on smiling  
And the world will smile with you  
  
When every race is run  
And the day is closing in  
I don't care about the world  
I'm living for the light  
Don't cry for me today' ah ah ah  
  
We live in a free world  
I whistle down the wind  
  
I can not be your judge  
Mr. Jailer is your host  
He's keeping you inside  
And hides you from the world  
No catcher in the rye  
Can help you from yourself  
  
We live in a free world  
I whistle down the wind  
  
Please Mr. Agony  
Release them for a while

Living without life  
  
We live in a free world


The man in the moon has a thousand different faces  
The man in the moon changes colours each day  
He's watching us all  
The big and the small  
Can he see  
Just you and me  
Searching for my destiny?  
Mercy, mercy  
You've gotta have pity on me  
Have mercy on me  
Mercy, mercy  
Wanna be free and happy  
Have mercy on me  
Do you believe we can travel into the future?  
Do you believe there's a man in the sky?  
We're making him sad,  
The good and the bad  
Can he see  
Just you and me  
Searching for my destiny?  
Ohh  
Mercy, mercy  
You've gotta have pity on me  
Have mercy on me  
Mercy, mercy  
Wanna be free and happy  
Have mercy on me  
I don't wanna be just one in many faces  
I want you looking at me  
Sit down and take a look  
Put me into motion  
Give me something to believe  
Mmm hmmm mmm  
Mmm hmmm mmm  
Mercy, mercy  
You've gotta have pity on me  
Have mercy on me  
Mercy, mercy  
You've gotta have pity on me  
Have mercy on me  
Ohhh,  
Mercy, mercy  
You've gotta have pity on me  
Have mercy on me, mmm  
Oh,  
Mercy, mercy  
You've gotta have pity on me  
Have mercy on me


I'm never gonna say I'm sorry,  
I'm a clown for everyone  
I'm never gonna let you down,  
I'm always here like a sun  
  
I'm a looser, that is a fact for sure  
I'm happy even if you don't want  
To invite me out for a dance tonight  
I'm not normal, I know, I don't care  
I'm never gonna say  
  
I'm always here like a sun, I'm always here  
Like a ghost I follow your steps so true  
You don't have to bribe me or fill me up  
Give me just a minute to shine with you  
I will make you so happy, make you laugh  
I'm never gonna say I'm sorry for  
  
The essence of my soul  
There's so many ways to change my life  
'Cause I want to, oh  
I'm like a clown, I'm fun for everyone,  
I'm never gonna say I'm sorry


They say the time has come for us  
To start again  
I believe that's true  
They say the time has come for us  
  
To make amends  
And I believe that too  
Why tell me why  
Is it all so hard to find  
  
I pray each day  
For a perfect world  
Where children are laughing  
Lovers romancing  
  
Time stands still  
A perfect world  
There's nothing to cry for  
No one to die for  
  
Wonderful  
In a perfect world  
Our father's father says that  
Things were better then  
  
How easy they forgot  
On every page in every book of history  
A thousand tears were shed  
There's hope in our hearts  
  
And love in our eyes  
Day after day I keep searching  
Why tell me why  
Is it all so hard to find  
  
I pray each day  
For a perfect world,  
Show me the way I'm to understand  
That you prove to myself that I'm a man  
  
And you love, but you can't look from above  
Travel cross the seven seas to be with you  
Passion and desire will see me through  
The road that I must travel will wind and curl  
You're all I ever needed in a perfect world


I was born in the shadows  
Under the Iberian sun  
I was the dawn of the valley  
Under the Iberian sun  
  
I once was a sinner  
But who was not?  
I really liked to rumble and hustle a lot  
But where is the key monster  
He is not here  
I am just a gatekeeper  
Now so sincere  
Now so sincere  
Now so sincere  
  
Who am I  
What is the purpose  
Who am I  
And where do I flee?  
Who am I  
I'd like to remember  
Who am I  
And who do I want to be  
Who do I want to be  
Who am I  
And who do I want to be  
  
I went down to the river  
Trying to find peace in my mind  
In the throw  
I saw you glimmer  
The desire for you made me blind  
I first saw you at the distance  
When the moon's at its height  
I came to get to know you  
A disclosure so bright  
I knew, in my heart  
When your flair made me swoon  
I am just a prisoner  
In search of my tune  
  
Who am I  
What is the purpose  
Who am I  
From where do I flee?  
Who am I  
I'd like to remember  
Who am I  
And who do I want to be


Hello mudda, hello fadda  
Here I am at camp granada  
Camp is very entertaining  
They say we'll have some fun when it stops raining  
  
I went hiking with joe spivy  
He developed poison ivy  
You remeber leonard skinner  
He got ptomaine poisoning last night after dinner  
  
All the counslers hate the waiters  
And the lake has alligators  
And the head coach wants no sissies  
So he reads to us from something called uylesses  
  
I don't want this, should I scare ya  
But my bunk mate has malaria  
You remember jeffery hardy  
They're about to organize a searching party  
  
Take me home, o mudda fudda  
Take me home, I hate granada  
Don't leave me out in the forest  
Where I might get eaten by a bear  
  
Take me home, I promise I will not make noise  
Or mess the house with other boys  
O please don't make me stay  
I've been here one whole day  
  
Dearest fadda, darling mudda  
How's my precious little brudda  
Let me come home, if you miss me  
I would even let aunt bertha hug and kiss me  
  
Wait a minute, it stopped hailing  
Guys are swimming, gals are sailing  
Playing base ball, gee that's bedda  
Mudda fudda kindly disregard this letter!

I'm sitting in my chair watching the TV  
It's not even on but there's plenty for me to see  
I just lit some crazy ass shit  
that my friend overnight mailed to me  
  
I'm fucking wasted  
It's the best shit I ever tasted  
I think they fucking laced it  
Cause I'm so damn lambasted  
  
Oh my friend came over so I packed him a pipe  
I told him he better go easy with this shit but he didn't believe the hype  
He sparked three bows just to show he could take it  
Two minutes later he was playing backgammon naked  
  
He's fucking wasted  
It's the best shit he ever tasted  
He's lost in fucking spaced-ed  
Cause he's so wicked wicked wasted  
  
Oh I spent the last two hours  
hiding under my bed  
Cause I looked in the garbage can  
and I think I saw my Uncle Louie's head  
  
I'm fucking wasted  
  
Well my friend blew a hit into my pet bird's face  
The bird laughed hysterically and started to moonwalk all over the place  
He tripped over the toaster wire and fell on his beak  
He looked at the two of us and he started to speak  
  
I'm fucking wasted  
It's the best shit I've ever tasted  
My brain's been erased-ed  
Well fucking fried  
  
I'm sitting in the bathtub wanting something to eat  
I wanted a pizza the bird said Pepperoni would be sweet  
Delivery guy showed up four hours later, handed me his shoe  
I said we ordered pizza buddy, what the hell's up with you  
  
I'm fucking wasted  
It's the best shit I ever fucking tasted  
Oh fucking shit  
  
I'm way too baked  
  


I'm a big fuckin' dick  
I'm a pain in your ass  
I drink all your beer  
I'll eat the last slice  
I'll give you charley horses  
I'll pull your shorts down at the beach  
I always need a ride  
Nobody likes me  
  
My name's Steve Motherfucking Polychronopolous  
  
I spit when I talk  
I swear in front of your mother  
I throw shit at the movies  
I wear tight pants  
I ask you to buy an extra Yankee ticket  
And then I don't show  
I tell you I saw your girlfriend  
Fucking two guys at a party  
  
'Cause my name's Steve Motherfucking Polychronopolous  
  
I'll piss on your toilet seat and tell your dad you got stoned  
I'll borrow your jacket and never think of returning it  
  
Polychronopolous  
Pansy  
Pussy  
Shit for brains  
Douchebag  
  
I'll leave your gate open  
So your dog runs away  
I'll make fun of your pimple  
Then I'll grab your sister's ass  
  
'Cause my name's Steve Motherfucking Polychronopolous  
  
And I don't care  
And I don't give a shit  
  
I'll break your brother's stereo  
And then tell him it was you  
You think you're better than me  
Well you're fucking wrong  
  
Everybody knows I'm Steve Motherfucking Polychronopolous  
  
Deal with it

Welcome my son to your very first day  
So proud to be the one  
Who brought you this way  
I love you with all my heart  
And my love is here to stay  
But I can't help worrying  
Will you eventually smoke weed?  
  
Soon enough you'll be walking  
You and me hand in hand  
The silly words you'll be talkin'  
Only daddy can understand  
We'll go out making snowmen  
Building castles in the sand  
And all the time I'm thinking,  
Will this kid end up smokin' weed?  
  
But time keeps on going  
And you keep on growin'  
You're now six years old  
You're getting so good at your spellin'  
But my mind is always dwellin'  
On the fact that you  
Could be the kind of guy  
Who grows up and needs  
To smoke weed on the couch  
All the time  
All the time  
  
So answer me this while  
You're lying in your little bed  
Why must you insist on bein'  
Such a fuckin' pothead?  
There's other things in life  
That can make you feel good  
But you just keep on smokin' your herb  
You can't get enough of  
Your precious, precious reefer  
Where you getting all this money  
To buy so much Hawaiian dope?


[Verse 1]  
I will leave my heart at the door  
I won't say a word  
They've all been said before, you know  
So why don't we just play pretend  
Like we're not scared of what's coming next  
Or scared of having nothing left  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Look, don't get me wrong  
I know there is no tomorrow  
All I ask is  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?  
  
[Verse 2]  
I don't need your honesty  
It's already in your eyes and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me  
No one knows me like you do  
And since you're the only one that matters, tell me who do I run to?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Now, don't get me wrong  
I know there is no tomorrow  
All I ask is  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?  
  
[Bridge]  
Let this be our lesson in love  
Let this be the way we remember us  
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious  
And I ain't asking for forgiveness  
All I ask is...  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?


[Verse 1]  
When did it go wrong, I will never know  
I have loved you all my life  
How did it slow down, I go round and round  
Thinking about it all the time  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I gave you heaven on a platter baby  
I gave you everything you never gave me  
I never lied and I never faked it  
Only wanted for you to save me  
This love, it ain't over yet  
There's too much that I haven't said  
  
[Chorus]  
Did you find the note that I wrote?  
I hid it in the seam of your coat  
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat  
Do you even know I can't let go  
  
[Verse 2]  
Why were you so cold, let the truth be told  
Tell me was it all for the thrill?  
What was I thinking, I gave you everything  
But you still went for the kill  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I gave you heaven on a platter baby  
I gave you everything you never gave me  
I never lied and I never faked it  
Only wanted for you to save me  
  
[Chorus]  
Did you find the note that I wrote?  
I hid it in the seam of your coat  
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat  
Do you even know I can't let go  
  
[Bridge]  
Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark  
Oooh I thought I'd die in your arms  
  
[Chorus]  
Did you find the note that I wrote?  
I hid it in the seam of your coat  
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat  
Do you even know that I can't let go  
  
[Outro]  
Hope you know, I won't let go


Found myself today singing out your name,  
You said I'm crazy,  
If I am I'm crazy for you.  
  
Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here  
Turns me crazy,  
But it's you who makes me lose my head.  
  
And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible  
You drift into my head  
And turn me into a crumbling fool.  
  
Tell me to run and I'll race,  
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,  
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,  
And make me crazy for you.  
Crazy for you.  
  
Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.  
I wish you'd come over,  
Send me spinning closer to you.  
  
My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,  
Strips me down bare  
And gets me into my favorite mood.  
  
I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,  
But the more I do,  
The crazier I turn into.  
  
Pacing floors and opening doors,  
Hoping you'll walk through  
And save me boy,  
Because I'm too crazy for you.  
Crazy for you


Daydreamer  
Sitting on the sea  
Soaking up the sun  
He is a real lover  
And making up the past  
Feeling up his girl  
Like he's never felt a figure before  
  
A jaw dropper  
Looks good when he walks  
Is the subject of their talk  
He would be hard to chase  
But good to catch  
And he could change the world  
With his hands behind his back, oh  
  
You can find him sittin' on your doorstep  
Waiting for a surprise  
And he will feel like he's been there for hours  
And you can tell that he'll be there for life  
  
Daydreamer  
With eyes that make you melt  
He lends his coat for shelter  
Plus he's there for you  
When he shouldn't be  
But he stays all the same  
Waits for you  
Then sees you through  
  
There's no way I  
Could describe him  
What I'll say is  
Just what I'm hoping for  
  
But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep  
Waiting for a surprise  
And he will feel like he's been there for hours  
And I can tell that he'll be there for life  
And I can tell that he'll be there for life


[Verse 1]  
Hello, it's me  
I was wondering if after all these years  
You'd like to meet, to go over  
Everything  
They say that time's supposed to heal ya  
But I ain't done much healing  
  
Hello, can you hear me?  
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be  
When we were younger and free  
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet  
  
[Pre-Chorus 1]  
There's such a difference between us  
And a million miles  
  
[Chorus]  
Hello from the other side  
I must've called a thousand times to tell you  
I'm sorry, for everything that I've done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you  
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore  
  
[Verse 2]  
Hello, how are you?  
It's so typical of me to talk about myself  
I'm sorry, I hope that you're well  
Did you ever make it out of that town  
Where nothing ever happened?  
  
[Pre-Chorus 2]  
It's no secret  
That the both of us are running out of time  
  
[Chorus]  
Hello from the other side  
I must've called a thousand times to tell you  
I'm sorry, for everything that I've done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you  
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore  
  
[Bridge]  
Ooooohh, anymore  
Ooooohh, anymore  
Ooooohh, anymore  
Anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
Hello from the other side  
I must've called a thousand times to tell you  
I'm sorry, for everything that I've done  
But when I call you never seem to be home  
  
Hello from the outside  
At least I can say that I've tried to tell you  
I'm sorry, for breaking your heart  
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore


[Verse 1]  
I want every single piece of you  
I want your heaven and your oceans too  
Treat me soft but touch me cruel  
I wanna teach you things you never knew, ooh baby  
Bring the floor up to my knees  
Let me fall into your gravity  
Then kiss me back to life to see  
Your body standing over me  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Baby, don't let the lights go down  
Baby, don't let the lights go down  
Baby, don't let the lights go down  
Lights go down, lights go down  
Lights go down, lights go down  
Down, down, down  
  
[Chorus]  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
  
[Verse 2]  
I love the way your body moves  
Towards me from across the room  
Brushing past my every groove  
No one has me like you do  
Baby, bring your heart, I'll bring my soul  
But be delicate with my ego  
I wanna step into your great unknown  
With you and me setting the tone  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Baby don't let the lights go down  
Baby don't let the lights go down  
Baby don't let the lights go down  
Lights go down, lights go down  
Lights go down, lights go down  
Down, down, down  
  
[Chorus]  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
  
[Bridge]  
We play so dirty in the dark  
Cause we are living worlds apart  
It only makes it harder, baby  
It only makes it harder, baby  
Harder baby, harder baby  
  
[Chorus]  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
I miss you when the lights go out  
It illuminates all of my doubts  
Pull me in, hold me tight  
Don't let go, baby give me light  
  
[Outro]  
I miss you, I miss you  
I miss you, I miss you  
I miss you, I miss you  
I miss you, I miss you


Right under my feet there's air made of bricks  
Pulls me down turns me weak for you  
I find myself repeating like a broken tune  
And I'm forever excusing your intentions  
That I give in to my pretendings  
Which forgive you each time  
Without me knowing  
They melt my heart to stone  
  
[Chorus]  
And I hear your words that I made up  
You say my name like there could be an us  
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love  
I'm the only one in love  
  
Each and every time I turn around to leave  
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed  
So desperately I try to link it with my head  
But instead I fall back to my knees  
As you tear your way right through me  
I forgive you once again  
Without me knowing  
You've burnt my heart to stone  
  
And I hear your words that I made up  
You say my name like there could be an us  
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love  
I'm the only one in love  
  
Why do you steal my hand  
Whenever I'm standing my own ground  
You build me up, then leave me dead  
  
I hear your words you made up  
I say your name like there should be an us  
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love  
I'm the only one in love


Picture perfect memories,  
Scattered all around the floor.  
Reaching for the phone cause, I can't fight it anymore.  
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.  
For me it happens all the time.  
  
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now.  
Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control and I need you now.  
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now.  
  
Another shot of whiskey, can't stop looking at the door.  
Wishing you'd come sweeping in the way you did before.  
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind.  
For me it happens all the time.  
  
It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk,  
And I need you now.  
Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now.  
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now.  
  
Yes I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all.  
It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now.  
And I said I wouldn't call but I'm a little drunk and I need you now.  
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now.  
I just need you now.  
Oh baby I need you now.


Sometimes the hole you left hurts my heart so bad  
It cuts through the deepest parts of me  
And fills up my mouth with words that I cry  
How I'm still trying to stay inside  
Hearts break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
Our hearts break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
Every now and then my memories ache  
With the empty ideas of the ones we'd made  
But as time goes on and my age gets older  
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rain  
'Cause heart break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
Our hearts break and hearts wait  
To make us grow from dust  
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh  
So that we know that it hurts  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal  
You know when to make me, I might just your heal  


I heard, that you're settled down  
That you found a girl and you're, married now  
  
I heard, that your dreams came true  
I guess she gave you things  
I didn't give to you  
  
Old friend, why are you so shy  
Ain't like you to hold back  
Or hide from the light  
  
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I  
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it  
I had hoped you'd see my face  
And that you be reminded that for me it isn't over  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best  
For you too, don't forget me  
I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love  
But sometimes it hurts instead  
Sometimes it lasts in love  
But sometimes it hurts instead yeah  
  
You know how the time flies  
Only yesterday it was the time of our lives  
We were born and raised  
In a summer haze bound by the surprise  
Of our glory days  
  
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I  
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it  
I hoped you'd see my face  
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you too  
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead  
  
Nothing compares no worries or cares  
Regrets and mistakes their memories made  
Who would have known how bittersweet  
This would taste  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you  
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead  
  
Never mind I'll find someone like you  
I wish nothing but the best for you too  
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you say  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead  
  
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead


[Verse 1]  
Looking for something I can be  
The fact I don't think it would mean  
The first half and I love the newspaper  
And the only way you want a boycott of the best way  
  
[Chorus]  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this  
I, I, I, I

[Bridge]  
Feel what better chance can do for you  
Feel what better chance can do for you  
Feel what better chance can do for you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Instead it will take the first half and I have  
Under pressure from the same as I am  
Whoever you can get the same as a result of the bestselling  
Great to have to do that in my room for a long day ahead with its own section  
  
[Chorus]  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this  
I, I, I, I  
I replaced with this

[Outro]  
Feel what better chance can do for you  
Feel...


[Verse 1]  
In the darkness of my heart is a shadow of your face  
From the deepest part of my regret  
I hear the words I wish I'd said  
At the dawning of the day  
I can't wait to see the light  
Make up memories in my head  
They help to fill the emptiness you've left  
  
[Hook]  
I can't drown in your tears  
I won't face your fears  
I need to fight my own  
  
[Chorus]  
You'll never see me again oh baby in time  
Let the wait take me under  
I know I'll survive  
You'll never see me again

Wanna taste your shortening bread

Gonna shake and bake you honey

I took a course in hallelujah  
I went to night school for the blues  
I took some stuff they said would cool ya  
But nothing seemed to light my fuse  
But it's all in the past  
Like a check that's in the mail  
She was a tall whiskey glass  
I was an old hound dog that just loved to chase his tail  
Until I met a blind man  
Who taught me how to see  
A blind man  
Who could change night into day  
And if I can  
I'm gonna make you come with me  
Because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds away  
  
I've had some lovers like a joy ride  
Some things are never what they seem  
My heaven's turned into a landslide  
I thank God I woke up from the dream  
Because here comes the sun and we'll be chasing all the clouds  
The way bees chase honey  
And drink all the flowers dry  
We'll be saving us a little money  
And if that don't do it, yeah, I know the reason why  
Don't make no sense lightin' candles  
There's too much moonlight in our eyes  
Because here comes the sun  
Ain't no surprise  
Ain't no doubt about it  
Gonna open up your eyes


Checkmate honey, beat ya at your own damn game  
No dice honey, I'm livin' on the astral plane  
Feet's on the ground, and your head's goin' down the drain  
Oh, heads I win, tails you lose, to the never mind  
Where to draw the line  
An Indian summer, Carrie was all over the floor  
She was a wet net winner, and rarely ever left the store  
She'd sing and dance all night, and wrong all the right out of me  
Oh, pass me the vile and cross your fingers, it don't take time  
Know where to draw the line  
Hi ho silver, we were singin' all your cowboy songs  
Oh, you told Carrie, and promised her you wouldn't be long  
Heads I win, tails you lose, lord it's such a crime  
No dice honey, you're the salt, you're the queen of the brine  
Checkmate honey, you're the only one who's got to choose  
Where to draw the line  
  
Checkmate, don't be late  
Take another pull  
That's right  
Impossible  
When you got to be yourself  
You're the boss, the toss  
The price, the dice  
Grab yourself a slice  
Know where to draw the line


Well I woke up this morning  
On the wrong side of the bed  
And how I got to thinkin'  
About all those things you said  
About ordinary people  
And how they make you sick  
And if callin' names kicks back on you  
Then I hope this does the trick  
'cause I'm sick of your complainin'  
About how many bills  
And I'm sick of all your bitchin'  
'Bout your poodles and your pills  
And I just can't see no humor  
About your way of life  
And I think I can do more for you  
With this here fork and knife  
Eat the rich  
There's only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more  
Eat the rich  
I gotta get this off my chest  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - spit out the rest  
So I called up my head shrinker  
And I told him what I'd done  
He said you best go on a diet  
Yeah, I hope you have some fun  
And a don't go burst the bubble  
On rich folks who get rude  
'Cause you won't get in no trouble  
When you eats that kinda food  
Now they're smokin' up their junk bonds  
And then they go get stiff  
And they're dancin' in the yacht club  
With muff and uncle biff  
But there's one good thing that happens  
When you toss your pearls to swine  
Their attitudes may taste like shit  
But go real good with wine  
Eat the rich  
There's only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more  
Eat the rich  
I gotta get this off my chest  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - spit out the rest  
Believe in all the good things  
That money just can't buy  
Then you won't get no bellyache  
From eatin' humble pie  
I believe in rags to riches  
Your inheritance won't last  
So take your gray poupon my friend  
And shove it up your ass  
Eat the rich  
There's only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more  
Eat the rich  
I gotta get this off my chest  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - spit out the rest  
Eat the rich  
There's only one thing that they are good for  
Eat the rich  
Take one bite now - come back for more  
Eat the rich  
Don't stop me now, I'm goin' crazy  
Eat the rich  
That's my idea of a good time baby


You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
  
You think you're in love  
Like it's a real sure thing  
But every time you fall  
You get yo' ass in a sling  
You used to be strong  
But now it's "ooh baby please"  
'Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees  
  
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
  
We was making love  
When you told me that you loved me  
I thought ol' cupid  
He was taking aim  
I was believer when you told me  
That you loved me  
And then you called me  
Someone else's name  
  
There ain't gonna be no more  
Beggin' you please  
You know what I want  
And it ain't one of these  
You're bad to the bone  
And your girlfriend agreed  
That falling in love is so hard on the knees  
  
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
You're so bad, you're so  
  
Chip off the old block  
Man, you're so much like your sister  
My fantasize it must be out of luck  
My old libido has been  
Blowing a transistor  
I feel like I have been hit by a fuck  
Yeah  
  
I'm Jones' in' on love  
Yeah I got the DT's  
You say that we will  
Bbut there ain't no guarantees  
I'm major in love  
But in all minor key  
'Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees  
  
What are you looking for  
It's got to be hard core  
Must be some kind of nouveau riche  
  
Is this your only chance  
Or some hypnotic trance  
Let's get you on a tighter leash  
  
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
You're so bad, you're so bad, you're so  
  
You ain't that good  
Is what you said  
Down to the letter  
But you like the way  
I hold the microphone  
Sometimes I good but  
When I'm bad I'm even badder  
Don't give me no lip  
I've got enough of my own  
  
There ain't gonna be  
No more beggin' you please  
You know what I want  
And it ain't one of these  
You're bad to the bone  
And your girlfriend agreed  
That falling in love is so hard on the knees  
  
I'm jonesin' on love  
Yeah I got the DT's  
You say that we will, yeah  
But there ain't no guarantees  
I'm major in love  
But in all minor key  
'Cause falling in love is so hard on the knees


I got a rip in my shoes  
And a hole in my brand new shoes  
I got a Margarita nose  
And a breath full of Mad Dog Booze  
I got the fever, fever, fever, fever  
Yeah, they threw me outta jail  
I tell ya it ain't fair  
I tried to kiss the judge  
From the electrica' chair  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight  
The guitar's cranked  
And the bass man's blown a fuse  
And when the whole gang bangs  
Then what is your excuse?  
I got the fever, fever, fever, fever  
Fever gives you lust with an appetite  
It hits you like the fangs  
From a rattlesnake bite  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight  
We can't run away from trouble  
There ain't no place that far  
But if we do it right at the speed of light  
There's the backseat of my car - caviar  
I was feelin' so high I forgot what day  
Now I'm feeling low down  
Even slow feels way to fast  
And now the booze don't work  
'Cause the drugs ran out of gas  
I got the fever, fever, fever, fever  
The buzz that you're gettin'  
From the crack don't last  
I'd rather be O.D.in' on the crack of her ass  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight  
My first time ever lover  
We fell asleep out on the lawn  
And when I woke up I was all alone  
Making love to the crack of dawn  
So yo, I beg yo pardon sir  
The gangster of love rides again  
You know I gotta chill  
It gimme such a thrill  
Like a burnin' plague  
Yeah get outta my way  
Fever may be Hell and a cross to bear  
As long as I'm in heaven, honey I don't care  
You look so good baby, look so fine  
I tell you you're the image of a perfect crime  
You get so tired holdin' on so tight  
If you think you're goin' crazy  
Well you may be right  
Yeah we're all here  
'Cause we're not all there tonight


Take me on your rocking horse  
Hit the lights and shut your doors.  
Grab your ankles , everyone.  
Ain't my way of having fun.  
Can't give it up, gotta give it up,give it up, c'mon Nancy.  
Can't give it up, get it up, for your fancy.  
Gotta get it up, get it up, c'mon Nancy.  
Can't get it up, gotta get it up, get it up,  
For your fantasies

And lots of luck into the night.  
Just waitin' for the bright light fright.  
Can't give it up, gotta give it up, get it up, c'mon Nancy.  
Really have a good time

Suckin' up the moonshine.  
Up underneath her clothesline.

Gotta get it up, get it up, c'mon Nancy.

For your fancy.  
Gotta get it up, get it up, get it up, c'mon Nancy.  
Can't get it up, gotta get it up, get it up,  
Get it up and down and all around.  
Take a ride and paint the town.  
Slow me down and make it fast.  
Scream almost and make it last.  
You know you gotta really have a good time.  
You know your really gonna, really have a good time.  
Suckin' up the moonshine.  
Up underneath the her clothesline.  
You know your really gonna, really have a good time.  
You know you really want to love me till the sun can't get it up. Get it up.


For all night Dwight  
  
Got a '56 Cadillac  
With a spare tire on the back  
Got a charge account in my ol' bank  
Said, I ain't got you  
  
Got a classic and a pool  
And a big hair ghoul  
No matter who I fool  
Said, I ain't got you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Got a baby and a liquor store  
I played the number four-forty-four  
Got a mojo and don't cha know?  
I'm all dressed up with no place to go  
Got women to the left of me  
Got women to the right of me  
I got chicks all around me  
Said, I ain't got you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mr. Whitford  
You know I ain't got you baby

Well I'm ready for you.  
I hope you're ready for me.

It shoots tombstone bullets with a ball and chain.  
I'm drinkin' TNT and smokin' dynomite.  
I hope some schoolboy pick a fight.

As ready as anybody can be.  
Well, I'm ready for you.  
I hope you're ready for me.

One more drink honey I wish you would.  
It takes a whole lotta lovin' to make me feel good.  
Cause I'm ready.  
As ready as anybody can be.

Dum, dum, dum, honey what have you done

Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Her whole world's come undone  
From lookin' straight at the sun  
  
What did her daddy do  
What did he put you through  
They say when Janie was arrested  
They found him underneath a train  
But man, he had it comin'  
Now that Janie's got a gun  
She ain't never gonna be the same  
  
Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Her dog day's just begun  
Now everybody is on the run  
  
Tell me now it's untrue  
What did her daddy do  
He jacked the little bitty baby  
The man has got to be insane  
They say the spell that he was under  
The lightnin' and the thunder  
Knew that someone had to stop the pain  
  
Run away, run away from the pain  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Run away, run away from the pain  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Run away, run away, run, run away  
  
Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Her dog day's just begun  
Now everybody is on the run  
  
What did her daddy do  
It's Janie's last I.O.U.  
She had to take him down easy  
And put a bullet in his brain  
She said 'cause nobody believes me  
The man was such a sleaze  
He ain't never gonna be the same  
  
Run away, run away from the pain  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Run away, run away, run, run away  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Run away, run away, run, run away  
  
Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Everybody is on the run  
Janie's got a gun  
Her dog day's just begun  
  
Now everybody is on the run (Honey, honey what's your problem)  
'Cause Janie's got a gun (Tell me it ain't right)  
Janie's got a gun (Was it daddy's cradle robbin')  
Her dog day's just begun (That made you scream at night)  
Now everybody's on the run  
Janie's got a gun  
  
Janie's got a gun  
Her dog day's just begun

With a pocket full of promises you never could keep  
From your best friends lover you dreamt about then

Workin' like a dog fo de boss man  
Workin' for de company  
I'm bettin' on the dice I'm tossin'  
I'm gonna have a fantasy  
But where am I gonna look?  
They tell me that love is blind  
I really need a girl like an open book  
To read between the lines  
  
[Chorus]  
Love in an elevator  
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down  
Love in an elevator  
Lovin' it up till I hit the ground  
  
Jacki's in the elevator  
Lingerie second floor  
She said 'can I see you later  
And love you just a little more?'  
I kinda hope we get stuck  
Nobody gets out alive  
She said I'll show ya how to fax in the mail room  
Honey and have you home by five  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the air, in the air, honey one more time not, it ain't fair  
Love in an elevator  
Lovin' it up when I'm goin' down  
  
Love in an  
Elevator  
Goin' down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gonna be a penthouse pauper  
Gonna be a millionaire  
I'm gonna be a real fast talker  
And have me a love affair  
Gotta get my timin' right  
It's a test that I gotta pass  
I'll chase you all the way to the stairway honey  
Kiss your sassafras  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you care? Do you care?  
Honey one more time now it ain't fair.  
Love in an elevator  
Livin' it up when I'm goin' down


Savin' all your money  
For a rainy day limousine  
Teenage baby send you  
Full friction magazine  
I don't know how she do it  
  
Up down turnaround  
Four on the floor tonight  
When she did what she was doin'  
She was rubbin' me the wrong way right  
Push come to shove  
Give it one more try  
Don't miss your water  
Until the well runs dry  
  
Love Me Like A Birddog  
Never Learn to Fly  
  
Bareback baby  
Tell me what's on your mind  
If it's the same old same old  
Slap you on the back behind  
I don't know how you do it  
Tell me one time  
About how it used to be  
You got the judge and jury  
Swinging from the highest tree  
Push came to shove  
Give it one more try  
Don't miss your water  
Until the well runs dry  
  
Love Me Like a Bird Dog  
Never learn to fly  
Ask me no questions  
I'll tell you no lies  
  
Love Me Like a Bird Dog  
Never learn to fly  
Ask me no questions  
  
Bass drum beating  
Like a hot damn house on fire  
Love lover's quarrels  
Always seem to make the body cry  
I don't know how she do it  
Tell me one time  
About how it used to be  
She got the judge and jury  
Swinging from the highest tree  
Push came to shove  
Give it one more try  
You don't miss your water  
Until the well runs dry  
  
Love Me Like a Bird Dog  
Never learn to fly  
Ask me no questions  
I'll tell you no lies

Oh... when you cross that line that you know you can't erase  
To fall in lust not love ain't no sin at all  
And tell me when your wit'chor best friend's friend  
Do you still feel outta place  
No thanks I took that ride  
God only knows I tried believin'  
I imagine everyone sometimes  
Will cross their heart and hope to die  
To tell I love you lies  
I imagine everyone survives  
For giving up all that you got  
To tell I love you lies  
The first time you look for love  
You find you don't know jack... yeah  
So much for mind games you play to win  
'Cuz first you lose your heart's desire  
Then you get it back  
But ignorance ain't bliss  
There's so much more behind the kiss...I'm feelin'  
I imagine everyone sometimes  
Will cross their heart and hope to die  
To tell I love you lies  
I imagine everyone survives  
For giving up all that you got  
To tell I love you lies  
When loneliness and paranoia feeds me  
God help the person...fff...who needs me...yeaah  
If ignorance is bliss then take me off the list  
I'm leaving  
I imagine everyone sometimes  
Will cross their hearts and hope to die  
To tell I love you lies  
I imagine everyone survives  
For giving up all that you got  
To tell I love you lies


Somebody better call a doctor, doctor  
Or wake me up with a shove

'Cause I can't, can't, can't let you go


Good evening people, welcome to the show  
Got something here I want you all to know  
When laughin' people bring on primal screams  
You got to think of what it's gonna take to make your dreams  
Make it  
Don't break it  
I said make it  
Don't break it  
Do then ya feel like the world's coming down on you  
You know that history repeats itself  
But you just learned so by somebody else  
You know you do, you gotta think up fast  
You gotta figure what it's gonna take to make it last  
Make it  
Don't fake it  
Said make it  
Don't fake it  
Better weather, pull yourself together  
Don't be catchin' the blues  
Better weather, pull yourself together  
What have you got to lose  
You're only paying your dues  
If you're gone I'll get you anyway  
Although you know what you've been going through


It ain't easy, livin' like a gypsy.  
Tell ya, honey, how I feel.  
I've been dreaming,  
Floatin' down stream and  
Losin' touch with all that is real.  
Whole earth lover, keepin' under cover  
Never knowin' where ya been.  
You've been fadin', always out paradin'.  
Keepin' touch with Mama Kin.  
  
Well you've always got your tail on the wag.  
Shootin' fire from your mouth just like a dragon.  
You act like a perpetual drag.  
You better check it out,  
Or someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon.  
  
It ain't easy, livin' like ya want to,  
And it's so hard to find piece of mind. Yes it is.  
The way I see it, you've got to say shit.  
But don't forget to drop me a line.  
  
Said you're as bald as an egg at eighteen.  
And workin' for you dad is just a drag.  
He still stuffs your mouth with your dreams.  
You better check it out,  
Or someday soon you'll have to climb back on the wagon.  
  
Keepin' touch with Mama Kin.  
Tell her where you've gone and been.  
Livin' out your fantasy,  
Sleeping late and smoking tea.  
  
Keepin' touch with Mama Kin.  
Tell her where you've gone and been.  
Livin' out your fantasy,  
Sleeping late and smoking tea.  
  
It ain't easy, livin' like ya want to,  
And it's so hard to find piece of mind. Yes it is.


The streets were cold and barren  
The nights were dark and dank  
And the sky, hadn't had a rain cloud in it for 25 years....  
The buildings were dead and the alleys  
Stunk from things that used to live there  
Ahhh that wasn't the city I remembered  
  
A Child in the street, barefoot pullin' at his  
Mama's tattered coattails: like a rat dogs existence  
With not a scrap left on the plate  
And so much like a fable, their lives so unstable  
Cause the only thing left was their faith  
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do  
About it....  
  
There's a Meltdown in the sky  
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why  
There's a fear that gets me high  
And the cold night numbs as the Jet Black clouds roll on by....  
  
So sad was the scene that my eyes did behold  
Made me wonder just who was the foe  
And was it all to come true what Nostradamus  
Had predicted such a long long time ago?  
You could hear screams and moanin'  
From the people atoning  
For their sins of a guilt ridden life  
And the final door shuts  
From the wind that leaves cuts  
From the edge on the blade of God's knife  
And there sure as hell ain't much I can do about....  
  
There's a Melt Down in the Sky  
There's a new day comin and I don't know why  
There's a tear stuck in my eye  
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why  
  
Battle lines had been drawn  
Mother nature how she cried  
By her side, till the dawn  
Couldn't kill her if they tried  
How they tried, open eyed, genocide  
Then... She died  
  
Battle lines had been drawn  
Mother nature how she cried  
By her side, till the dawn  
Couldn't kill her if they tried  
How they tried, open eyed, genocide  
Then... She died  
  
There's a Meltdown in the sky  
There's a new day comin' and I don't know why  
There's a fear that gets me high  
And the cold night numbs as the Jet Black clouds roll on by....


Hush-a-bye my baby soft and new  
Ooh her loveliness, gypsy dance in the rain  
Hush-a-bye my baby what you do  
Ooh, the baby cries, the wind she's a-callin' your name  
Mia  
  
Where you came from you ain't alone  
Live and loved from the old jaw bone  
Ahh don't you cry, you're home sweet home  
  
Rock-a-bye sweet lady gypsy blue  
Ooh, the nightingale's singin her song in the rain  
Hush-a-bye sweet lady soft and new  
Ooh don't you cry, the wind she's a-screamin' your name  
  
Come too soon that sunny day  
You give your heart away  
No divorcee, no repouise


Well I tried everything  
Just to get along with you  
And I'm gonna tell you just  
What I'm gonna do  
  
Well I'm sick of all your cryin'  
When you should be leavin' me alone  
If you don't believe me  
You pack me bags, I'm gone  
  
Won't cha please  
Don't that sun look good goin' down  
You almost lost your love girl  
When your old man ain't around  
  
Won't you please  
Don't that sun look good goin' down  
When your old man ain't around  
  
Won't you please  
Don't that sun look good goin' down  
And you best believe I love ya baby  
When your old man ain't around  
  
Won't you please  
Don't that sun look good goin' down  
When your old man ain't around  
  
Round and round


The fortune teller looked into my eyeballs  
The wrinkles on her face about to crack  
She said 'you best believe it,  
You ain't goin' nowhere, unless you get that  
Monkey off your back'  
I made believe the devil made me do it  
I was the evil leader of the pack  
You best believe I had it all and then I blew it  
Feedin' that fuckin' monkey on my back  
If you put it a spoon man I would boot it  
Some king whose mental house was just a shack  
Where do you draw the line when all your friends are dyin'  
You got to get that monkey off your back  
Uh, uh, uh....  
Your crystal ball is where you chase the dragon  
She said, 'now' I bring me home his head inside a sack  
But now you find your crystal balls are draggin'  
Got to get that monkey off your back

Popcorn, popcorn, cheese cake, cheese cake

Listen here  
Some like 'em short, some like 'em tall  
Some like 'em thin, skinny legs and all  
I like 'em buttered, I like 'em proud  
And when they walk, you know they'll draw a crowd

Talk with yourself

Wake up baby, what you in for  
Start the day upon your knees  
What you pissin' in the wind for  
You musta snorted too much bleas  
East house pinball wizard  
Full tilt bozo plague

Hey Betty Boop you got me droolin'  
I'm buzzing 'round your hive tonight  
You play the hooky stead of schoolin'  
Son of a bitch put out the light  
Thirteen year old hookers  
Take a sack right trough the bars  
You wonder why the man's outside the door  
Junior achivers, got the old bull by the horns  
  
Back in the saddle gets you sore  
My fist your face  
That's for sure  
East house pinball wizard  
Full tilt bozo plague

My girl, she breathes hellfire  
And my girl, she feeds my desire  
My girl Sadie, she's the wind in my sails  
A puss'n boots lady with a cat o' nine tails  
Comin' after you honey, feet don't fail me now  
  
My girl, she's bare back rider  
And my girl, she's Lady Godiva  
She's a full time love no mon ami  
Sweeter than honey from a honeybee  
And it all rubs off on little old me, oh  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Slippin' in and out of love  
  
My girl, she smokes barbed wire  
And my girl, can't get no higher  
I made it with the lady and a one track mind  
Diamonds in the rough, they're so hard find  
Day after day, the same old grind  
And grind and grind and grind  
My girl, my girl, my girl, my girl  
  
My girl, she's bare back rider  
And my girl, she's Lady Godiva  
She's a full time love no mon ami  
Sweeter than honey from a honeybee  
And it all rubs off on little old me, oh  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Slippin' in and out of love  
Oh, my girl!


You're a no good heartbreaker  
You're a liar and you're a cheat  
I don't know why I let you do these thing to me  
My friends keep telling me that you ain't no good  
They don't know that I would leave you if I could  
I guess I'm on tight  
And I'm stuck like glue  
Cause I ain't never  
I ain't never  
I ain't never, no, no,  
Loved a girl the way that I  
I love you  
  
Sometimes I know I thought  
You would run out of fools  
But I was so wrong  
You got one that you'll never lose  
The way you treat me is shame  
How could you hurt me so bad  
Baby you know that I'm the best thing that you ever had  
Kiss me once again  
Don't you never never say that we're through  
Cause I ain't never  
Never  
Never no no  
Loved a girl the way that I  
I love you  
  
I can't sleep at night I can't eat a bite  
I guess I'll never be free  
Since you got your hooks in me  
  
I ain't never loved a girl  
I ain't never loved a girl  
Ain't never loved a girl that hurt me so bad  
What am I gonna do about it  
I tell you I'm gonna hold on to her  
I'm gonna hold on to her


Blood stains the ivorys  
Of my Daddy's baby grand  
I ain't seen no daylight  
Since we started this band  
No More, No More  
No More, No More  
  
Store bought clothes  
Fallin' appart at the seams  
Tea leaf readin' gypsies  
Fortune tellin' my dreams  
  
No more, no more  
No more, no more  
  
Holiday inns, lock the door with a chain  
You love it and you hate it  
But to me they're all the same  
  
No more, no more  
No more, no more  
  
Baby I'm a dreamer  
Found my horse and carriage  
  
Stalemate jailbait  
Ladies can't refuse  
You love 'em then you leave 'em  
With your sold out reviews  
  
No more, no more  
No more, no more  
  
Sweet talkin' barroom, ladies disease  
Slippin' with her lips  
Slidin' down your knees  
  
No more, no more  
No more, no more  
  
Baby I'm a screamer  
Bound to a wife in marriage  
Baby, I'm a dreamer  
Found my horse and carriage  
  
Ladies hold the aces  
And their lovers call it passion  
The men call it pleasure  
But to me it's old fashioned  
  
Times they're a changin'  
Nothin' ever stands still  
If I don't stop changin'  
I'll be writin' out my will  
  
It's the same old story  
Never get a second chance  
For a dance to the top of the hill  
  
Baby I'm a dreamer  
Found my horse and carriage


Nineteen seventy one  
We all heard the starters gun  
New York is such a pity  
But at Max's Kansas City we won  
  
We all shot the shit at the bar  
With Johnny O'Toole and his scar  
And then old Clive Davis said  
I'm surely gonna make us a star  
I'm gonna make you a star  
Just the way you are  
  
But with all his style  
I could see in his eyes  
That we is goin' to trial  
  
It was no surprise  
  
The boys kept kickin' ass  
As usual time would tell  
But some bitch in the choir  
Threw water on the fires of hell  
She loved to show and tell  
Lord she loved to tell  
  
But with all our style  
You could see in our eyes  
That we is still on trial  
  
And it was no surprise  
No surprise  
No surprise  
No surprise  
  
Midnight lady  
Situation fetal  
Vaccinate your ass  
With a photograph needle  
  
I say  
Look it here  
Friend of mine  
Scratch like you need calomine  
Flamingo boots  
Sole's a creakin'  
Still in love and Puerto Rican too  
  
Ridin' on the wheels of hell  
Smokin' in our axle grease  
Oh the backstage is rockin'  
And we're coppin' from the local police  
That's right the local police  
Or the justice of peace  
  
But with all our style  
You could see in our eyes  
That we is still on trial  
  
Baby it's no surprise  
No Surprise  
No Surprise  
No Surprise  
  
Rock and roll  
Junkie whore  
Got my foot inside the door  
Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock  
Nobody's keepin' score  
  
Bad times  
Go away  
Come again some other day  
Topaz and sazzafrazz  
Will keep the blues away  
  
Candy store  
Rock and roll  
Corporation jellyroll  
Play the singles it ain't me  
It's programmed insanity  
  
You ASCAP  
If BMI  
Could ever make a mountain fly  
If Japanese can boil teas  
Then where the fuck's my royalties


Lord I must be dreamin'  
What else could this be  
Everybody's screamin'  
Runnin' for the sea  
  
Holy lands are sinkin'  
Birds take to the sky  
The prophets all are stinkin' drunk  
I know the reason why  
  
Eyes are full of desire  
Mind is so ill at ease  
Everything is on fire  
Shit piled up to the knees  
  
Out of rhyme or reason  
Everyone's to blame  
Children of the season  
Don't be lame  
  
Sorry  
You're so sorry  
Don't be sorry  
  
Man has known  
And now he's blown it  
Upside down  
And hell's the only sound  
We did an awful job  
And now they say  
It's nobody's fault  
  
Old San Andreas  
Seven years ago  
Shove it up their Richters  
Red lines stop and go  
  
Noblemen of courage  
Listen with their ears  
Spoke but how discouragin'  
When no one really hears  
  
One of these days you'll be sorry  
Too many houses on the stilt  
Three million years or just a story  
Four on the floor up to the hilt  
  
Out of rhyme or reason  
Everyone's to blame  
Children of the season  
Don't be lame  
  
Sorry  
You're so sorry  
Don't be sorry  
  
Man has known  
And now he's blown it  
Upside down  
And hell's the only sound  
We did an awful job  
And now we're just a little too late  
  
Eyes are full of desire  
Mind is so ill at ease  
Everything is on fire  
Shit piled up in debris  
  
California showtime  
Five o'clock's the news  
Said everybody's concubine  
Was prone to take a snooze  
  
Sorry  
You're so sorry  
Don't be sorry  
  
Man has known  
And now he's blown it  
Upside down  
And hell's the only sound  
We did an awful job  
And now we're just a little too late


These days are slipping away like thieves in the night  
I try to hold on to them with all my might  
Precious time spent with you goes by much too fast  
Like snow in the sun it just never seems to last  
  
Another tasteless coffee  
Another empty day  
Suddenly last night is just so far away  
Too many talking heads  
What was it that they said  
When we're apart the days are dark  
When I'm with you I'm in the light  
  
You're my oasis in the night, yeah  
You're my oasis in the night  
You're my oasis in the night  
You keep our love light shinning bright  
You're my oasis in the night, yeah  
  
When you're in my arms you keep the world at bay  
You stop it at the door  
I don't care what they say  
Time's too short  
The fire's too hot  
Don't know what to do  
'Cause I know in a flash  
It's just a memory too  
  
Another tasteless coffee  
Another empty day  
Suddenly last night is just so far away  
Too many talking heads  
What was it that they said  
When we're apart my days are dark  
When I'm with you I'm in the light  
  
You're my oasis in the night  
You're my oasis in the night  
You're my oasis in the night  
You're my oasis in the night  
  
I think I'll die  
I just can't wait  
  
Till our next oasis in the night, yeah  
Aah till our next oasis in the night  
Till our next oasis in the night, yeah  
You're my oasis in the night


Yeah, woke up one mornin'  
I'm a ram up for walls  
Somethin' told my baby  
You can have it all  
Jump trough the window  
Look my life in the den  
Look out pretty mama  
I'm On The Road Again  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm On The Road Again  
(And you can do what you want)  
I'm On The Road Again  
(And you can do what you want)  
Yeah, I came home last night  
To get my dinner hot  
Went to the door  
But the door was locked  
Jump through the window  
And believe me or not  
She hadn't even  
Put my dinner into the pot  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Yeah, never been evil  
And I've never been shy  
Every down a champ  
And I'm a time by  
Down un winner  
With my apple in bed  
Look out pretty mama  
I'm On The Road Again  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Yeah, never been evil  
And I've never been sly  
Every down a champ  
And I'm a time by  
Down in the window  
With my apple in bed  
Look out pretty mama  
I'm On The Road Again


Been lucked out  
Broke a woman's heart  
With only myself to blame  
Fate ran it's course  
I suffered a loss  
I learned a lesso in pain  
  
Cheated, lied  
I took love for granted  
Oh, I paid the price  
I won't last a night  
I won't make the same mistake twice  
  
Once Is Enough, it's one time too many  
The changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough  
  
Love went trough such sudden change  
Taken a turn for the worst  
The joy turned to fear  
The pain got so severe  
Lord, I thought I was cursed  
  
Get what you give  
It comes around full circle  
Oh, I paid the price  
Love so fast  
I won't make the same mistake twice  
  
Once Is Enough, it's one time too many  
Changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough  
Changes are rough, oh, Once Is Enough


Hey look yonder  
What's that I see  
Well that old bogus, honey  
Comin' after me  
  
I goin' told you  
Was out of town  
I wonder how she knowed  
I was hangin' around  
  
Say, listen babe  
Don't go wastin' your time  
You keep comin' 'round  
You'll hear the same old line  
  
You got a thousand boys  
You say you need 'em  
You take what's good for you  
And I'll take my freedom  
  
'Cause lately it's been so hard  
To make ends meet  
And honey, you're headin' down a  
One way street  
And I gotta go the other way  
(Heh, heh, heh)  
  
I thought I knew her  
My cagey lady  
How come my sunshine  
Was so damn shady  
She'll say she love to talk  
A conversation  
But I'm the one  
Who makes my situation  
  
This one way city  
That I thought I knew  
It's such a pity, honey  
That's it for you  
'Cause lately it's been so hard  
To make ends meet  
And honey, you're headin' down a  
One way street  
And I gotta go the other way  
  
There's nothing over here  
I never showed you  
I made it pretty clear  
I'm glad to know you  
  
You know your brother Spike  
He's on the level  
But you always lookin'  
Like you're mad at the devil  
  
Don't say I cop a 'tude  
It's all forgotten  
It's just you're much too rude  
Your fruits are rotten  
  
You know I work so hard to keep it alive  
Now all I hear from you  
Is nothing but jive  
  
Lately it's been so hard  
Now to make ends meet  
And honey, you're headin' down a  
One way street  
And I'm goin' on the other way  
Yes I do!  
  
And lately it's been so hard  
To make ends meet  
And honey, you're headin' down a  
One way street  
And I really been feelin'  
Like I could be movin' on  
  
You're headin' down a one way street  
You're foolin' everybody you meet  
I said, you're headin' down a one way street  
You're foolin' everybody but me  
I said, you're headin' down a one way street  
You're foolin' everybody you meet  
I said, you're headin' down a one way street  
You're foolin' everybody but me...  
You got to get yourself back on your feet


All the way back in a history  
How a girl thinks is a mystery  
We spend our lives cruisin' the bars  
The Venus girls and the men from mars  
So in all this time did you ever think  
Do the girl see red when the man sees pink  
And if your best lovin's in the past  
'Cuz you're somewhere slow is nowhere fast  
You're outta your head... yeah  
So outta your head... yeah  
Stay outta your head  
You better get with it  
'Cuz you're so without it  
You're outta your head... yeah  
So outta your head... yeah  
Stay outta your head  
(Somewhere somewhere underneath the rainbow)  
Aaar...bricka braka fiya kraka sis boom-bah  
Here's comes trouble in a push up bra  
Your style is sharp as carpet tack  
But you're out of your box and you're way off track  
You can moderate on a mental binge  
Your catastrophe's on a lunatic fringe  
It's good for the gander it's tit for tat  
You say it's all good but it's more than that  
You're outta your head... yeah  
So outta your head...yeah  
Stay outta your head  
You better get with it  
'Cuz you're so without it  
You're outta your head...yeah  
So outta your head...yeah  
Stay outta your head  
So in all this time did you ever think think think think think...  
So outta your head...yeah  
So outta your head...yeah  
Stay outta your head  
You better get with it  
'Cuz you're so without it  
So outta your head...yeah

When I'm in heat  
Someone gets a notion  
I jump to my feet  
I hoof it to the ocean  
We hit a beach  
Where no one gives a hoot  
Nobody never ever wears a suit  
The ladies there  
They look so proud  
That's 'cause they know  
That they've been so well endowed  
  
Now, I ain't much  
For Fannie's conversation  
Or care to much  
About her operation  
But every time Pandora comes my way  
I get high  
Can't explain the sensation  
To get it on  
I gotta watch what I say  
Or I'll catch hell  
From the women's liberation  
  
[Chorus:]  
Sweet Pandora  
Good-like aura  
Smell like a flora  
Open up your door-a for me  
Sweet Pandora  
Good-like aura  
Smell like a flora  
Open up your door-a for me  
Sweet Pandora  
Mama crack a smile for me  
Just for me, just for me  
Just for me, just for me  
Just for me, just for me  
Just for me  
  
Now I ain't what  
You'd call a city slicker  
Or claim to fame  
To be a slitty licker  
  
But every time Pandora comes my way  
I get high  
Can't explain the sensation  
To get it on  
I gotta watch what I say  
Or I'll catch hell  
From the women's liberation  
  
[Chorus]


I got a letter from a friend the other morning  
He say it's hot down by Montego Bay  
I got the point and now I think it's finally dawning  
Yeah, yeah, I got to get away  
I got to take myself a Permanent Vacation  
The sky's the limit, but my plane won't fly  
My nose is clean and Lordie don't need no sedation  
Yeah, yeah, and that's the reason why  
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez  
I want a tan where the sun it never shines  
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez  
You best believe it that I got to get away  
I got a sister, man she really got a pin head  
She think she kinky but she can't get straight  
She say she livin', but I kinda think she's brain dead  
Just excess baggage on a late night freight  
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez  
I want a tan where the sun it never shines  
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez  
You best believe it that I got to get away  
I gotta take me on a Permanent Vacation  
The girl's be cummin' down in Cayman Brack  
I gotta hand it to a firm situation  
Yeah, yeah, got to cut me some slack  
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez  
I want a tan where the sun it never shines  
I really need it, really, really need St. Tropez  
I really need it, really need it, really really...


Pink, it's my new obsession, yeah  
Pink, it's not even a question  
Pink, on the lips of your lover  
'Cause pink is the love you discover  
Pink, as the bing on your cherry  
Pink, 'cause you are so very  
Pink, it's the color of passion  
  
'Cause today it just goes with the fashion  
Pink, it was love at first sight  
Yeah pink, when I turn out the light  
And pink gets me high as a kite  
And I think everything is going to be alright  
No matter what we do tonight  
  
You could be my flamingo  
'Cause pink, it's a new kinda lingo  
Pink, like a deco umbrella  
Ffff, it's kink that you don't ever tell her  
Yeah, pink, it was love at first sight  
Then pink when I turn out the light  
Yeah, pink gets me high as a kite  
And I think everything is going to be alright  
No matter what we do tonight  
  
Yeah,  
I, want to be your lover  
Ffff, I I wanna wrap you in rubber  
And it's pink as the sheets that we lay on  
'Cause pink, It's my favorite crayon  
  
Yeah  
Pink, it was love at first sight, yeah  
Pink, when I turn out the light  
Yeah pink, it's like red but not quite  
And I think everything is going to be alright  
No matter what we do tonight


At first we three thought  
'Twas the biblical cord of life  
Then noticing 'twas connected to his head  
  
How strange, not to believed  
I reached out to feel, and the pony's eyes opened  
The cord got hard, the head looked around  
And you know who pushed and gushed  
The waters of life  
First two hooved feet, then the shine of his fur  
  
But at first to my eyes only  
Feather - feathers - wings  
The butterflies flew up in such colors  
Exploding all around us  
  
The rest I did not see - till there he stood - all eyes in wonder  
  
Who me - who you  
  
Look


[Chorus:]  
Can you be in love  
When you live alone  
Push comes to shove  
When you're bitchin' on  
  
Now look at every  
I'm tonne on you without a doubt  
Said the music does the talkin'  
But all we heard is talk about  
  
The girls are left behind  
When forty women all spend time  
With me and the boys  
And the toys, yeah  
  
Rose said she was fine for two  
With blonde hair, by crack it  
Miles of blue  
Suze, she was on my side  
'Cause she and Nancy  
Ah they took me for a ride  
  
The girls are left behind  
When forty women all spend time  
With me and the boys  
And they do, yeah the toys  
  
Talk about it  
Walk about it  
Talk about it  
Talkabubi  
Talk about it  
Talk about it...  
Dedumdudidudi  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She looked, well, about thirty five to me  
When mine was still comin' on to you  
But I was covered back, back then  
'Cause me and the boys  
Knew hot courier  
  
The girls are left behind  
When forty women all spend time  
With me and the boys  
And the toys in the attic  
  
Her sister, she was lank and thin  
Never thought I'd given in  
Her candle of youth was burnin' low  
But me and the boys  
Knew something had to go  
  
The girls are left behind  
When forty women all spend time  
With me and the boys  
Dededudidudu...  
  
Talk about it  
Walk about it  
Talk about it  
Talkabubi  
Talk about it  
Talk about it...  
Dedumdudidudi  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Huh!  
  
[Chorus]

Goin' under, rats in the cellar  
Goin' under, skin's turnin' yellow  
Nose is runny, losin' my connection  
Losin' money, getting no affection  
  
New York City blues  
East side, West side lose  
Throw me in the slam  
Catch me if you can  
Believe  
That you're wearing  
Tearing me apart  
  
Safe complaining, 'cause everything's rotten  
Go insanin', and ain't a thing forgotten  
Feelin' cozy, rats in the cellar  
Cheeks are rosy, skin's turning yellow  
Loose and soggy, lookin' mighty lazy  
Super party, pushin up a-daisies  
  
New York City schools  
East side, west side lose  
Throw me in the slam  
Catch me if you can  
Believe  
That you're wearing  
Tearing me apart

When it's time to crash  
But when I get home tonight, Lord

There's a Red House over yonder  
That's where my baby stays  
There's a Red house over yonder  
That's where my baby stays  
I ain't been home to see my baby  
Seems like 99 and one half days  
Now wait a minute  
I think something's wrong here  
The key won't unlock this damn door  
Now wait a minute  
I think something's wrong here  
The key won't unlock this fucking door  
Something bad just because of it  
My baby don't want me no more  
That's her loss, that's my gain  
I'm gonna head out back yonder, I think  
Back yonder over the hill  
I'm gonna head out back yonder, I think  
Yonder over the hill  
Over the hill  
'Cause if my baby don't  
Love me no more  
I know her sister will


Seems like the other day,  
My baby went away,  
She went away,  
Across some sea.  
  
It's been two years or so,  
Since I saw my baby go,  
And then this letter,  
Came to me.  
  
It said ??  
She found somebody new,  
Oh, lemme think, lemme think,  
What shall I do?  
  
Oh no, oh no, oh no no no no no.  
Remember,  
Walking in the sand.  
Remember,  
Walking hand in hand.  
Remember,  
The night was so exciting.  
Remember,  
Her smile was so inviting,  
Remember,  
And then she touched my cheek,  
Remember,  
With her fingertips.  
Remember,  
Softly, softly we met with a kiss.  
  
Whatever happened to,  
That girl that I once knew.  
That girl that said she'd be true.  
Whatever happened to,  
That night I gave her to you.  
What will I do with it now.  
  
Oh no, oh no, oh no no no no no.  
Remember,  
Walking in the sand.  
Remember,  
Walking hand in hand.  
Remember,  
The night was so exciting.  
Remember,  
Her smile was so inviting,  
Remember,  
And then she touched my cheek,  
Remember,  
With her fingertip.  
Remember,  
Softly, softly we met with a kiss.  
  
Whatever happened to,  
That girl that I once knew.  
That girl that said she'd be true.  
Whatever happened to,  
That night I gave her to you.  
What will I do with it now.

Its nuclear my Rocket 88

Let's fire it up and watch the rockets glow  
Gee suit, g-spot, gee I really must admit

So no more up against the wall  
Just come with me and watch the earth get small  
I swear you never will come down at all  
So if you like it in your face  
I'll rub your nose into outer space  
And turn into a red hot fireball


I want to jump but I'm afraid I'll fall  
I want to holler but the jones' too small  
Young man really got the hold to it too  
I got the Rockin' Pneumonia And The Boogie Woogie Flu  
  
Want some lovin', baby, that ain't all  
I want to kiss her but the girl's too tall  
Young man really got a hold on it too  
I got the Rockin' Pneumonia And The Boogie Woogie Flu

Young man really got a hold on it too

If you believe in me  
Like I believe in you  
You wouldn't be tellin' me things  
That weren't exactly true  
  
Now everything changes  
Ain't got nothing to say  
I'm having the strangest feeling, baby  
I can't remember my name  
  
'Cause the life I've been livin'  
And the love I've been givin'  
Will be sure to send you spinnin'  
With your feet never touching the ground  
Goin' round n' round  
  
When it was one for all  
And it was all for one  
And everything that we did  
Never bothered anyone  
  
Now everything changes  
Ain't nothing the same  
I'm having the strangest feeling, baby  
I can't remember my name  
  
'Cause the life I've been livin'  
And the love I've been givin'  
Will be sure to send you spinnin'  
With your feet never touching the ground  
Goin' round n' round  
  
Can you remember the days  
When you were sweet sixteen  
And always followed the ways  
Of someone else's dream  
  
(Look here)  
Now everything changes  
Ain't nothing the same  
I'm having the strangest feeling, baby  
I can't remember my name  
  
Goin' round n' round n' round n' round...


Get yourself cooler, lay yourself low  
Coincidental murder, with nothing to show  
When the judge's constipation go to his head  
And his wife's aggravation, you're soon enough dead  
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend  
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend  
  
Gotcha with the cocaine they found with your gun  
No smoothy face lawyer to getcha undone  
Say love ain't the same on the south side of town  
You could look, but you ain't gonna find it around  
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend  
It's the same old story, same old story  
Same old song and dance  
  
Fate comes a-knockin', doors start lockin'  
Your old time connection, change your direction  
Ain't gonna change it, can't rearrange it  
Can't stand the pain when it's all the same to you, my friend  
  
When you're low down and dirty, from walkin' the street  
With your old hurdy-gurdy, no one to meet  
Say love ain't the same, on the south side of town  
You could look, but you ain't gonna find it around  
It's the same old story, same old song and dance, my friend  
It's the same old story, same old story  
Same old song and dance


It's deep insignus  
That knows me well  
It's all around me  
My mind can tell  
  
And all the children  
They know my name  
They scream forever  
I know the pain  
  
Oh, feel the pain  
Oh, feel the pain  
Oh, feel the pain  
Oh, feel the pain  
  
It's a sleep insignus  
That knows me well  
She's got the fever  
She's hot as hell  
  
And all the children  
They know my name  
When night is coming  
They'll scream in pain  
  
Oh, scream in pain  
Oh, scream in pain  
Oh, scream in pain  
Oh, scream in pain  
  
Yayaya...


Blues hearted lady sleepy was she,  
Love for the devil brought her to me.  
Tears of a thousand drawn to her sin,  
Seasons of wither holdin' me in.  
  
Ooh woe is me I feel so badly for you.  
Ooh woe is me I feel so sadly for you.  
In time bound to lose your mind,  
Live on borrowed time,  
Take the wind right out of your sail.  
  
Fireflies dance in the heat of,  
Hound dogs that bay at the moon.  
My ship leaves in the midnight,  
Can't say I'll be back too soon.  
  
They awaken far far away,  
Heat of my candle show me the way.  
Tears of a thousand drawn to her sin,  
Seasons of wither holdin' me in.  
  
Ooh woe is me I feel so badly for you.  
Ooh woe is me I feel so sadly for you.  
In time bound to lose your mind,  
Live on borrowed time,  
Take the wind right out of your sail.


I was a city boy  
Caught up in a city way  
A nitty gritty boy  
Was out all night  
And always gettin' blown away  
  
[Chorus]  
There ain't no breeze to cool the heat of love  
  
She was a city girl  
With no responsibility  
A pretty little city girl  
All fired up and what's  
That got to do to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's as clear as a  
Sunrise in Sedona  
Just what it is  
That's blowin' in the wind  
It's the fire in her eyes  
It's the tear when she cries  
Its the heat when I fall on my knees(yeah)  
That I'm thinkin' of  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Its as clear as a  
Sunrise in Sedona  
Just what it is  
That's blowin' in the wind  
It's the fire in her eyes  
It's the tear when she cries  
It's the heat when I fall on my knees  
That I'm thinkin' of  
  
[Chorus]

Oooh, she's on fire  
Oooh, she's on fire  
Hot to trot, she's a bit insane  
Little bit a pleasure  
With a little bit a pain  
I got to be smokin'  
So I know without a doubt  
Where there's smoke there's fire  
So I gotta boot it out  
Say oooh, she's on fire  
Oooh, she's on fire  
Homely child with a hang down lip  
Starved for love and companionship  
Little by little, catchin' up to me  
She's more of a woman  
Then I thought she'd be to me...yeah  
Hungry girl, she's the skinniest thing  
She's sayin' the word, I'm losin' sting ?  
She's on fire  
She hung my head in a guillotine  
She's my flame, she's a wettin' my dream  
She's on fire  
Oooh, she's on fire  
Oooh, she's on fire  
Oooh, she's on fire  
Oooh, she's on fire


Talk is cheap, shut up and dance  
Don't get deep, shut up and dance  
Love has got me down  
The weight is all around  
So you lend a hand to peace on earth  
Here's my piece, now what's it worth  
Yea, but it's all right  
When you can't define the crime  
Then life ain't worth a dime  
When they take away everything you got  
And they rub your nose in the funky spot  
Not without a fight  
When you work your fingers to the bone  
And what does that get you--nothing  
If in a crowd of people  
You're still alone I hope that tells you something  
The road to heaven is paved in hell  
And it makes you wonder  
Why you're here at all  
Check out the shape of your circumstance  
He wears the dress and she wears the pants  
Here comes Jill and she needs romance  
But you can't do jack so shut up and dance!  
Sex is like a gun  
You aim, you shoot, you run  
When you're splittin' hairs with Mr. Clean  
It' like gettin' head from a guillotine  
And the night has just begun  
Talk is cheap, shut up and dance  
Don't get deep, shut up and dance


Please, I just got to talk to you  
Please, well keep your head out of the loo  
Please, we're a long, long way from home  
Please, you'd turn a young man's face to stone  
  
[Chorus:]  
Sick as a dog, what's your story  
Sick as a dog, a cat got your tongue  
Sick as a dog, you'll be sorry  
Sick as a dog, 'cause you're really ain't that young  
  
Please, you were much to my surprise  
Please, you're a lady in disguise  
Please, you're the only friend I got  
Please, you're the last to see me rot  
  
Please, it's a shame you're so refined  
Please, she was the last thing on my mind  
Please, don't be late to take it light  
Please, you're gonna bay into the night  
  
Say goodnight


Goin' downtown, goin' down, goin' down  
'neath the city, eatin' ground round  
Underground is pretty gritty  
I turned the screw she held the light  
That's when I knew she was a  
  
Sight for sore eyes  
She was a sight for sore eyes  
  
Playin' no fair, sleepin' under stairs  
Downtown's a pity, takin' fair square  
Under where it's pretty gritty  
I turned the screw, she held the knife  
  
Oh, holy jesus, she's a sight for sore eyes  
Sight for sore eyes  
She's a nitty grutty  
  
Turnin' in style, walk a mile for your titty  
Naked foul while under there  
Under where it's pretty gritty  
Hey, don't you know people  
She's a love lust hussy  
She left, oh she rust me  
Dear old girl  
She was a sight for sore eyes  
But she was sittin' pretty  
A sight for sore eyes  
She was a nitty gritty  
Sight for sore eyes  
  
Peeled back and parted  
Even at the start it was delight or demise  
I feel like a leopard king  
Sight for sore eyes  
She was a sight for sore eyes


I need a lady, not somebody shady  
Need someone to be close to  
Somebody cozy, not somebody nosey  
Help me see my whole day through  
  
Someone to share the load  
Somebody to walk the road I live on, live  
  
Good Lord send me, good Lord mend me  
Send me down someone for me  
Said I won't be choosy  
You could send me a floosy  
Send me anybody you please  
Somebody say you will  
Somebody further still  
Somebody, some, somebody for me  
Now won't you send me somebody  
Yeah, somebody  
  
Won't you send me somebody  
Now won't you send me somebody  
Well, call for somebody  
Scream loud and bloody  
Call woman, woman, come on to me  
Save for tomorrow  
Share all your sorrow  
Misery enjoys company  
Yes it does, yes it does


You're making me wait like there's no tomorrow  
You're taking from me what I can't beg or borrow  
  
There's something that tells me that life has changed  
There's something that tells me this isn't a game  
There's something that tells me that you'll hit the floor  
There's something that tells me  
That you got everything you need but all you want is more  
  
You know there was dreams I had in my corner  
I made you a dollar, you gave a quarter  
  
There's something that tells me that life has changed  
There's something that tells me this isn't a game  
There's something that tells me that you'll hit the floor  
There's something that tells me  
That you got everything you need but all you want is more  
  
Yeah  
  
Yeah  
  
There's something that tells me that life has changed  
There's something that tells me this isn't a game  
There's something that tells me that you'll hit the floor  
There's something that tells me  
That you got everything you need but all you want is more


Cyberotic head explode  
Information overload  
And I just can't take anymore  
And I'm gonna break  
Something's gotta give  
Tell me when to turn the screw  
Does the noise in my head bother you  
Something's gotta give  
Comic books are comin' true  
Does the noise in my head bother you  
Digerotic mass appeal  
Feels like flesh but tastes unreal  
And I'm gonna break  
Something's gotta give  
Tell me when to turn the screw  
Does the noise in my head bother you  
Something's gotta give  
Don't you like it  
Tell me true  
Does the noise in my head bother you  
Something's gotta give  
Hold your breath 'til you turn blue  
Does the noise in my head bother you  
Something's gotta give  
Comic books are comin' true  
Does the noise in my head bother you  
If love that seemed to fall from grace  
Was sitting on your interface  
Your megahertz she can't forgive  
Your love it died before you ever lived  
Something's gotta give  
Tell me when to turn the screw  
Does the noise in my head bother you  
Something's gotta give  
Don't you like it  
Tell me true  
Does the noise in my head bother you  
Something's gotta give  
Hold your breath til you turn blue  
Does the noise in my head bother you  
Something's gotta give  
Comic books are comin' true  
Does the noise in my head bother you


Spaced in time child of nine  
Doin' twenty years on the way  
Fire and steel earth unreal  
Find another planet to stay  
Papa died ma survived  
Tellin' me about her ordeal  
And the soul she could not feel  
'Cause they made her so unreal  
Lightnin' years disappears  
Twenty million years on my brain  
Synthesize overrides  
Tryin' to keep from goin' insane  
And my soul I can not feel  
'Cause they made me so unreal  
Spaced enough to know I feel there's nothin' out there  
Spaced enough to know I feel I really don't care  
Spaced enough to feel I'm really losin' my mind  
And I'm never never never never ever goin' back  
I'm off the track no one even knows I'm alive  
Spaced without a trace  
Waitin' for the word to arrive  
I'm the last man to survive


Spiderman, spiderman  
Does whatever a spider can  
Spins a web, any size  
Catches thieves just like flies  
  
Look out here comes the spiderman  
  
Is he strong, listen bud  
He's got radioactive blood  
Can he swing, from a thread  
No escape from his spider-web  
  
Look out there goes the spiderman  
  
When chill meets the night  
at the scream of a crime  
Like a stream of light  
He arrives just in time  
Look out, life is a great big bang-up  
Wherever there is a hang-up  
You'll find the spiderman.

I sold my soul for a one night stand  
I followed Alice into Wonderland  
I ate the mushroom and I danced with the queen  
Yeah we danced in between all the lines  
I followed daylight right into the dark  
Took to the Hatter like a walk in the park  
But then I met her yeah she felt so right  
No child of the night yeah was she  
They called her sunshine  
The kind that everybody knows...yeah yeah  
Sunshine  
She finer than a painted rose...yeah yeah  
Sunshine...yeah  
Her kind of love's what I adore  
What kind of trouble am I in for  
My kinda heaven lies at hell's back door  
And I got more than I need  
'Cuz I need sunshine  
The kind that everybody knows...yeah yeah  
My sunshine  
She finer than a painted rose...yeah yeah

The caterpillar's tryin' to cop a plea  
But the smoke ain't got nothin' on me  
Ya gotta have my sunshine  
The kind that everybody knows...yeah yeah  
The sunshine  
She finer than a painted rose...yeah yeah  
Sunshine  
The kind that everybody knows...yeah yeah

God I love the sweet taste of India  
Lingers on the tip of my tongue  
Gotta love the sweet taste of India  
Blame it on the beat of the drum  
  
God I love the sweet taste of India  
Lingers on the tip of my tongue  
Gotta know that what's gotten into you  
Any cat man do when it's done  
  
Yeah, she's got that kind of love incense  
That lives in her back room  
And when it mixes with the funk my friend  
It turns into perfume  
  
When you are born  
You're afraid of the darkness  
Then you're afraid of the light  
But I'm not afraid  
When I dance with my shadow  
  
This time I'm gonna get it right  
To think of what I'll get tonight  
Just lookin' for a little taste  
(A Taste Of India)  
She'll steal the smile right off your face  
  
Her Yin and Yang  
Is just the thing  
She's unpredictable my friend  
  
God I love the sweet taste of India  
Lingers on the tip of my tongue  
Gotta know that what's gotten into you  
Any cat man do when it's done  
  
It's like your first taste, love, of vindaloo  
That sets your heart on fire  
And if you let her stuff get into you  
It will be all that you desire  
  
When you make love to  
A sweet tantric priestess  
You drink in the bliss of delight  
But I'm not afraid  
When I dance with her shadow  
  
This time I'm gonna get it right  
She's gonna wake my appetite  
Just lookin' for a little taste  
(A Taste Of India)  
She'll steal the smile right off your face  
  
She a friend of mine  
She a concubine  
The sweetest wine  
I gotta make her mine  
  
God I love the sweet taste of India  
Lingers on the tip of my tongue  
Gotta love the sweet taste of India  
Blame it on the beat of the drum  
  
God I love the sweet taste of India  
Lingers on the tip of my tongue  
Gotta know that what's gotten into you  
Any cat man do when it's done  
  
Just think of what I'll get tonight  
She's gonna wake my appetite  
Just lookin' for a little taste  
(A Taste Of India)  
She'll steal the smile right off your face  
  
Yow, yow...

I never thought a first time love would ever last  
How could a kiss like that  
Knock me flat on my ass  
  
The burning bed  
The roses dead  
And now I'm dancing with myself  
  
Yeah,  
I'm missing you  
Just like you want me to  
You made me trip into the grind  
Now I can't get you off of my mind  
  
Yeah,  
Your sweet talking hip shaking wobble gonna blow a man away  
Kiss butt, and guess what  
Even double crossin' dogs have their day, ha  
So forget about, regret about, you're right I ain't afraid to say  
  
Yeah, I'm missing you  
Just like you want me to  
You made me trip into the grind  
Now I can't get you off  
  
And the more I try  
Leads to the same old why  
You made me slip into the grind  
Now I can't get you off of the cloud we was on  
And now it's all gone  
Tell me why, why, why, why  
Why ain't I getting through  
Ain't no lie there out of love, love, love  
  
Tell me was it good, for you  
  
Tell me what you want  
  
Yeah, cause I'm missing you  
Just like you knew I'd do  
You made me trip into the grind  
Now I can't get'choo off  
And I know I tried  
Leads to the same old why  
You made me trip into the grind  
Now I can't, can't, can't get you  
Get you [Repeat: x4]  
Get you [Repeat: x3]  
  
Off of my mind

Get your sweet ass off the floor  
Doctor, doctor, doctor  
I can't refuse any loose hearted lady anymore  
  
I scream your name into the crowd  
You feel the flame but you ain't proud  
Maybe your attitude ain't right  
So all that's left for me to do is bite  
The hand that feeds me  
Feeds me  
  
Doctor, doctor, doctor  
Doctor, doctor, please  
  
All things you put me through  
What the hell you want me to  
Do all the things that uncle John needs

Et tu like birds of a feather

Thinkin 'bout the night life  
In the ladies powder room  
Brother's like a howlin' wolf in the light of the silvery moon  
Joey's like a Pavlo's dog when he starts to salivate  
A Hardly man himself is hard to shake his rattle snake

And who you do it with

With the boys in Aerosmith

You keep knockin' but you can't come in  
The way you love I adore  
You always come never know where you been  
But a-now I'm here baby to even the score  
  
You're up, you're down  
You're always running in place  
Triathlon if you please  
You're always beggin' me for a taste  
But I ain't up to snuff if you sneeze  
  
Yak yak yak  
  
Lord you give me the bends  
Heads and tails  
You're all out of love  
  
[Chorus:]  
Like the reason a dog  
Has so many friends  
He wags his tail instead of his tongue  
  
Your older sister  
She's a lot like you  
She likes to grab my microphone  
Now there ain't too much she won't do  
Especially when we're all alone  
  
You're up, you're down  
You're always runnin' in place  
Triathlon if you please  
Her mind's on rewind and erase  
You might get shot, babe  
When you're shootin' the breeze  
  
Yak yak yak  
  
Lord you give me bends  
You're heads and tails  
Are calling for love  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Your older sister  
She's a lot like you  
And there ain't too much she won't do  
  
There's always something  
That you got to say  
I lose my mind and then I surely fade away, yeah  
  
Yak yak yak  
  
Lord you give me the bends  
You're heads and tails  
Now look what you done  
  
[Chorus x2]


When will the clouds all blow it away  
When will the good people have their say  
Now I hope you're still around to see the day  
  
[Chorus]  
Take a while, think about it  
Take a while, think about it  
Take a while, think about it  
  
Who's gonna tell what is up or down  
Who can be the king or be the clown  
Then climb your tree, take a look around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take it nobody out, if it in the tame  
That which is now, will be again  
Who can decide who is insane  
  
[Chorus]


This Little Light of Mine (Light of Mine),

Take a walk in the warm New England sun  
Ain't no time to look for clues  
You get the point from Uncle Sam's loaded gun  
Who be the hand that light the fuse, ah  
  
Take a look, take a look at my old billy goat  
He used to raise all kinds of hell  
He took a dose of radiation dope  
Back in the barn is where he fell, like hell

You could have a better ride now  
Open your eyes  
  
Because no one here can ever stop us  
They can try but we won't let them  
No way-ay-ay-ay-yeah-ah  
  
Maybe you and I  
Could pack our bags and say goodbye  
  
Then fly away from here  
To anywhere

And our hopes and dreams  
Are out there somewhere  
Fly away from here (ya ya ya)  
Yeah anywhere  
Now honey, I don't I don't I don't fly (yeah)  
  
We just fly (fly away)


In the attic lights  
Voices scream  
Nothing's seen  
Real's a dream  
  
Leaving the things that are real behind  
Leaving the things that you love from mind  
All of the things that you learned from fears  
Nothing is left for the years  
  
Voices scream  
Nothing's seen  
Real's a dream  
  
[Chorus:]  
Toys, toys, toys in the attic  
Toys, toys, toys in the attic  
Toys, toys, toys in the attic  
Toys, toys, toys in the attic  
  
Lights  
Voices scream  
Nothing's seen  
Real's a dream  
  
Leaving the things that are real behind

Nothing is left for the years  
  
Voices scream  
Nothing's seen

Yeeeah...  
Yak goa goa...  
I got a wild thing for you  
We're talkin' hoops you got me jumpin' thru  
You got those lemon drop martini eyes  
And if my karma suits you  
Cross the line into another place and time  
Tell me how pretty she is  
When she turns the colors of the rainbow

One more night with you...no stoppin'  
Ain't no smokin' fantasy  
'Cuz lovin' you is trippin' to me

You got my situation bone-a-fide

That all I really needed was your love  
To yeah forever shine on me  
Promise promiscuity is like waiting for your ex-to-see that  
One more day with you...trip hoppin'... yeah  
One more night with you...no stoppin'  
Yeah yeah yeah

And now the only way out is thru  
One more night with you

One more day won't do  
(One more day won't do)  
Yeah  
How beyond the rainbow is my

Uncle Salty told me stories of a lonely  
Baby with a lonely kind of life to lead  
My mammy was lusted, Daddy he was busted  
They left her to be trusted till the orphan bleeds  
But when she cried at night, no one came  
And when she cried at night, went insane  
  
Uncle Salty told me when she was just a baby  
That she'd get by and maybe someday she'd see  
But soon she found her mother's love for all the others  
The pushers and the shovers was the life to lead  
But when she cried at night, no one came  
And when she cried at night, went insane  
  
Oooh, it's a sunny day outside my window  
Oooh, it's a sunny day outside my window  
Oooh, oh yeah  
Oooh, oh yeah, yeah yeah  
  
Now she's doin' any for money and a penny  
A sailor with a penny or two or three  
Hers is the cunning for men who come a-runnin'  
They all come for fun and it seems to me  
That when she cried at night, no one came  
And when she cried at night, went insane  
  
Oooh, it's a sunny day outside my window [Repeat to fade]

High class  
Moolah  
Bolt ons  
Fast car  
Quick fix  
Freak out  
Nose bleed  
Skull cap

You make me feel so good 'cause you're so bad  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hey little darlin'

Love's four letters  
Ain't in my dictionary  
'Scuse my position  
But it ain't missionary

Well, the cook's in the kitchen  
And hidin' the spoons

But it ain't missionary  
Yeah, but I want to  
Walk on the water with you


For certain she was the face of springtime,  
The flowers stood and paid their due.  
And all the folk, they sang of a good rhyme  
While drinking all they wanted to.  
A bitter sweet, this final evening,  
Before he must leave her side...  
  
They danced around the glass filled tables  
While fiddlers played so sweet and low.  
Their eyes hard fixed upon each other,  
However would she let him go?  
And when the time it came upon them,  
She said in case we forget...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
  
The letters came and every single Sunday  
We all would wait to hear the news.  
She knew her love would be home someday,  
The only thing she held on to.  
We sang a song just like we used to  
And she said before we could leave...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
  
That night she heard her true love calling  
With words that only she could know.  
They held each other till the morning  
And when it was his time to go.  
She said...  
  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
Just a little bit more, just a little bit more.  
  
Just a little bit more.


I'm just a wandering gypsy  
I'll sing for you tonight  
And when the seats are empty  
I'll turn and walk into my spotlight  
And I'll be in the place where I belong  
  
For who will tell the story  
Except someone like me  
Of tragedy and glory  
Of lovers as they walk so blindly  
And try to find a place where they belong  
We all must find a place where we belong  
  
Everybody knows me  
Everone shows me  
And I'll be here when you have gone  
For the road to carry on  
We all must find a place where we belong  
  
If destiny has spoken  
If finally the dawn has broken  
We all must find a place where we belong  
  
I'm just a wandering gypsy  
I've sung for you tonight  
And now the seats are empty  
I'll turn and walk into my spotlight  
And I'll be in the place where I belong


Night-  
And the world is fast asleep  
I will hold you here and keep  
All our secret dreams and plans  
  
You-  
Never thought our love could last  
Now you've put that in the past  
Cause you finally understand  
  
That after all  
The times you told me that we'd never be good together  
After all the things you said  
That made me think that you'd never call  
Now you've turned around and told me  
That you want to stay here forever  
And you're back here in my arms  
Where you belong  
After all  
  
We-  
All the promises we made  
All the words we never said  
Never knowing what was right  
  
You didn't know-  
That the love we used to share  
Wasn't cause it wasn't there  
We'll make up for it tonight  
  
That after all  
The times you told me that we'd never be good together  
After all the things you said  
That made me think that you'd never call  
Now you've turned around and told me  
That you want to stay here forever  
And you're back here in my arms  
Where you belong  
After all  
  
We were young  
And your dreams took you places far from me  
I was wrong  
To believe  
That you'd go  
Cause here you are  
  
That after all  
The times you told me that we'd never be good together  
After all the things you said  
That made me think that you'd never call  
Now you've turned around and told me  
That you want to stay here forever  
And you're back here in my arms  
Where you belong  
After all


Hit with the bug to run, you didn't go to college we can use you son  
You look like the pride of your home town  
But how can you hold out when your luck is down  
  
[Chorus]  
Ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame, ain't it a shame.  
Because I'm too tired to run around  
Meeting people from the wrong side of town  
Looking for a place to live, I've got no money nothing to give, listen  
All you gotta do is look around for something that's new  
find a job that's stimulating, that's easy and I'm still waiting  
  
(Chorus)  
I've stood in line and done my time  
With nothin' to do all day  
I've stood in line with all my friends  
With nothin' to say all day,  
I've stood in line and done my time  
With nothin' to do all day  
I've stood in line with all my friends  
With nothin' to say all day, nothin' to say all day.  
Got brains but got no drive  
Money's cheap, the roads are wide  
All the good positions go too fast  
I need a job I know will last  
I've got a job for you can you push that shovel can you swing that broom  
Keep your head down and don't go slow  
But don't forget to stop with the whistle.  
(Chorus


When I was young  
I never needed anyone  
And making love was just for fun  
Those days are gone  
  
Livin' alone  
I think of all the friends I've known  
But when I dial the telephone  
Nobody's home  
  
All by myself  
Don't wanna be  
All by myself  
Anymore  
All by myself  
Don't wanna live  
All by myself  
Anymore  
Hard to be sure  
Sometimes I feel so insecure  
And love's so distant and obscure  
Remains the cure  
  
All by myself  
Don't wanna be  
All by myself  
Anymore  
All by myself  
Don't wanna live  
All by myself  
Anymore  
  
When I was young  
I never needed anyone  
And making love was just for fun  
Those days are gone  
  
All by myself  
Don't wanna be  
All by myself  
Anymore  
All by myself  
Don't wanna live  
All by myself  
Anymore  
  
All by myself  
Don't wanna be  
All by myself  
Anymore


I'm lying alone with my head on the phone  
Thinking of you till it hurts  
I know you hurt too but what else can we do  
Tormented and torn apart  
I wish I could carry your smile and my heart  
For times when my life feels so low  
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring  
When today doesn't really know, doesn't really know  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm all out of love, I'm so lost without you  
I know you were right believing for so long  
I'm all out of love, what am I without you  
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong  
  
I want you to come back and carry me home  
Away from this long lonely nights  
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too  
Does the feeling seem oh so right  
And what would you say if I called on you now  
And said that I can't hold on  
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day  
Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, what are you thinking of?  
What are you thinking of?  
Oh, what are you thinking of?  
What are you thinking of?  
  
[Chorus x3]


There's got to be an alternate ending.  
There's got to be an easy way out.  
I've got to make a change to the messages I'm sending.  
It's all gone wrong, give me time.  
It's all my fault, could have told you.  
Before it's gone too far.  
  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
  
Stay with me awhile, I know we belong together.  
I just want to see you smile and change your mind.  
  
There's got to be an alternate ending.  
There's got be an easy way out.  
I've got to be the one to say I'm sorry for pretending.  
It's all gone wrong, will you wait?  
It's all my fault, will you listen... to me?  
  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
  
Stay with me awhile, I know we belong together.  
I just want to see you smile and change your mind.  
Stay with me awhile, all that we've done together.  
I've got no rights and I've got no style, but love is blind.  
  
Stay with me awhile, I know we belong together.  
I just want to see you smile and change your mind.  
Stay with me awhile, all that we've done together.  
I've got no rights and I've got no style, but love is blind.  
  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.  
One love, true love, real love can last forever.


I can see hills touch the sky  
Heaven and earth, you and I  
A world we will always be  
Here in the silence we lie  
Shadows we cast, you and I  
Speak for eternity  
  
[Chorus]  
Pressed between pages  
Flowers will die  
Stories may end as time passes by  
You and I will always be  
  
With every word that I hear  
Whenever whispers are near  
I can believe in fate  
Promises made, only one  
  
Yesterday fades from the sun  
And falls to a new embrace  
Years overflow  
As rivers run dry  
  
Here in a moment of time passing by  
You and I will always be, will always be  
  
[Chorus]


They were married in September back in 1969  
They travelled, these two Indians,  
To find some peace of mind  
They stood for love and freedom  
They were children of their time oh oh  
  
They lived in a world that was cold and uncaring  
They swore they would change it  
with loving and shareing  
They'll never live like their parents have done  
Their innocence shone like the sun  
  
American hearts, so filled with emotion  
American hearts, so easily broken  
  
Now they've got a family and a cottage in the hills  
He's always working late to pay the mortgage and the bills  
And she has trouble sleeping  
So the doctor gives her pills oh oh  
  
Who are these strangers who used to be lovers  
Now they've got nothing to say to each other  
Too far apart to discuss their mistakes  
They filed for divorce and it breaks their  
  
American hearts, so fiIled with emotion  
American hearts, so easily broken  
  
Ah - American hearts  
Ah - American hearts, American hearts  
  
Now that it's over they'll each go on living  
Never forgetting but somehow forgiving  
They'll care for their children protect them with pride  
And that's how their dream will survive in  
  
American hearts, so filled with emotion  
American hearts, so easily broken  
  
American hearts, so filled with emotion  
American hearts, so easily broken

Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
  
I'm going back just a few years  
All people used to seem tall  
When everyday would be voices calling  
I'd take no notice at all  
I'd take no notice at all  
Then when I asked if you'd  
Held conversation  
I was the talk of the town  
Until the voice let me see in the future  
They didn't look so way down  
  
I have to make them listen  
Or they may never come back  
I have to make them listen now  
  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
  
And so I heard and I saw  
Something happening  
They were just like you and me  
But they were wiser and all had the message  
We really had to believe  
We really had to believe  
  
They showed me how the world keeps on turning  
It's not as hard as it seems  
So many secrets you wouldn't believe in  
They manufacture our dreams  
  
I have to make you listen  
Or they may never come back  
I have to make you listen now  
  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
  
I was afraid of things that I can't see  
I can't see love but I like it a lot  
I used to take a life in the back seat  
Until the front row began to move off  
There must be more to sleep than waking  
I was so sure there was something waiting  
There  
  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
Believe in the supernatural  
  
I'm going back just a few years

Between us I'm the stranger  
Who never does the things that people do  
I let it through  
  
  
Believer  
We always seem to shine  
Believer  
You're always reaching high

It's like a storybook romance  
Everything is so right with the prince in the trees  
Waiting underneath the window for you  
Any moment he'll sing you a melody  
When you're hard and start a life on your own  
If you always knew the ending had to come true  
  
  
Believer  
I've got a troubled mind  
Believer  
We've got to break it down  
Somewhere inside is a weakness  
That wants to be discovered  
Just like you  
I'll help you too  
  
  
It's like reading a storybook romance  
Everything is so right with the prince in the trees

Big cat walking on the wild side  
Big cat talking on the wild side  
He knows he looks the way he should  
He's got something making him feel good  
He's got the style, he's got the sway  
He's a million miles away  
  
She cat walking on the wild side  
She cat talking on the wild side  
She don't smile, she don't look  
She don't do laundry and she don't cook  
She's not listening to what he says  
She's not making any promises  
  
He just wants to love someone  
She just wants to love someone  
He just wants to hold someone  
She just wants to love someone  
  
Big cat walking on the wild side  
Big cat stalking on the wild side  
She cat walking on the wild side  
She cat talking on the wild side  
He's thinking how she's not so tough  
Could be a diamond sitting in the rough  
She's staring out to empty space  
She's wondering how long he will take  
  
He just wants to love someone  
She just wants to love someone  
He just wants to hold someone  
She just wants to love someone  
  


Blue, blue is the color of skies  
Blue is the color of your eyes  
Your beautiful blue eyes  
Black, black is the color you wore  
Black is the promise you made before you closed  
the door  
And never told me why  
  
I'm black and blue because of you  
I feel like I've been beaten  
You walked away from me  
Leaving me all black and blue  
  
You, you used to sleep by my side  
You swore you had nothing to hide  
And now there's nothing left to lose  
  
Night, night after long endless night  
You swore you had nothing to hide  
And I was so naive to believe your lies  
  
I'm black and blue because of you  
I feel like I've been beaten  
You walked away from me  
Leaving me all black and blue  
  
Down in the depths of your soul  
I hear the echo and the sigh that your secrets  
can not hide  
They never lie to me  
  
Night, night after long endless night  
You swore you had nothing to hide  
And I was so naive to believe your lies  
  
I'm black and blue because of you  
I feel like I've been beaten  
You walked away from me  
Leaving me all black and blue  
  
Broken in two because of you  
I feel like I've been beaten  
You walked away from me  
Leaving me all black and blue  
  
Black and blue because of you  
I feel like I've been beaten  
You walked away having me all black and blue.


The more you win, the more you gain  
An open window to the human brain  
The more you give, the more you lose  
You can't go dancing in these mountain shoes  
And that won't do.  
The more you touch, the more you feel  
It's just a picture that you thought was real  
The less you need, the more you know  
You can say the prophet told you so  
Do do dooo  
CHORUS  
You and me, we've got enough  
We live inside the body glove  
You and me, we live for love  
Deep inside the body glove  
You and me, we've got enough  
We live inside the body glove  
You and Me, we live for love  
Deep inside the body glove  
The body glove.  
VERSE 2  
The world is just potato chips  
Joined together at the female hips  
The Universe we left behind  
We never know what we are going to find.  
Do do dooo  
And when we want to be alone  
To get away, baby, to another zone  
The word is out, the clothes are in  
And who knows maybe it's another sin  
CHORUS  
You and me, we've got enough  
We live inside the body glove  
You and Me, we live for love  
Deep inside the body glove  
You and me, we've got enough  
We live inside the body glove  
You and Me, we live for love  
Deep inside the body glove  
The body glove  
The body glove  
The body glove  
The more you win, the more you gain  
An open window to the human brain  
The more you touch, the more you feel  
It's just a picture that you thought was real  
You thought was real  
CHORUS  
You and me, we've got enough  
We live inside the body glove  
You and Me, we live for love  
Deep inside the body glove  
You and me, we've got enough  
We live inside the body glove  
You and Me, we live for love  
Deep inside the body glove  
The body glove  
The body glove  
The body glove  
  


The book of love, that sacred place  
Where we walk tall, or in disgrace  
Who tills the ground on which we tread  
Who gives us all our daily bread  
The spirit woken from its sleep  
The demon stirring from the deep  
Whose gates at dawn we all must pass  
The last one first, the first one last  
Whose words must be both black and white  
Whose music shall be day and night  
The moon that tells us of the sun  
Where voices soar so far above  
These pages are the book of love  
  
If we were born just to succeed  
If life was meant to be a choice  
For either happiness or greed  
If you can't walk, you'll always run  
Away from anyone, yes you will  
  
But if we learn to take our time  
As though each moment is a treasure  
That's not so hard to find  
When you are free, then suddenly  
There's room for everyone, yes there is  
  
CHORUS  
The book of love, the world of dreams  
Those shadows fall upon us all  
And send our weary eyes to sleep  
But when you wake, your heart will make  
Some room for everyone  
  
Just come to me  
There's nothing you should fear  
Just come to me  
I'll always be right here  
I tell you now  
Your heart is where I live  
And what you ask, is what I'll give  
  
If we were born just to succeed  
If life was meant to be a choice  
For either happiness or greed  
If you can't walk, you always run  
Away from anyone, yes you will  
  
But if we learn to take our time  
As though each moment is a treasure  
That's not so hard to find  
When you are free, then suddenly  
There's room for everyone, yes there is  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  


I'm not afraid of losing you or saying good-bye  
If someone needs you more than me, I will understand why  
I'd never stand between someone who's holding your heart  
But I can't let a superstition tear us apart  
Who has the right to speak fire from above  
If heaven is away from you, that is the place I will give up  
For falling in love can't be taking these lips from the cup  
  
Don't fill her mind with bread and blood  
Don't confuse strength with pride and mud  
I have a faith in love that's thicker than all bread and blood  
  
I'm not afraid to face the truth of what I believe  
If love was never meant to choose, it could never succeed  
And we may always stand alone in everyone's sight  
And be the judge unto ourselves between wrong and right  
Who puts a price on eternity's sin  
Who throws the first stone shall search for perfection again  
For you are the reason that pleasure was taken from the pain  
  
Don't fill her mind with bread and blood  
Don't confuse strength with pride and mud  
I have a faith in love that's thicker than all bread and blood  
  
I won't see you cry, should it make you cry  
  
Don't fill her mind with bread and blood  
Don't confuse strength with pride and mud  
I have a faith in love that's thicker than all bread and blood  
  
Don't fill her mind with bread and blood  
Don't confuse strength with pride and mud  
I have a faith in love that's thicker than all bread and blood


When all else fails and you have nothing  
You know you really should believe in something  
Take a look at what you have  
To a dream that's not all that bad  
Don't waste time with all your thinking  
Wake up now your dreams are sinking  
Making the change is up to you  
You'll accept nothing less than the best  
  
Come, come, come on  
Bring out the magic  
Come, come, come on  
Bring out the magic  
  
It's much quicker than the eye  
It's you mind and it's there all the time  
Say goodbye this is tomorrow  
Make your mind up not to follow  
You can lead yourself away Understand You can have what you say  
  
Come, come, come on  
Bring out the magic  
Come, come, come on  
Bring out the magic  
  
You can stay with me now  
And tell me what you know  
You can stay with me now  
And tell me all you know  
  
Come, come, come on  
Bring out the magic  
Come, come, come on  
Bring out the magic  
  


I can't fight this feeling any longer  
And yet I'm still afraid to let it flow  
What started out as friendship has grown stronger  
I only wish I had the strength to let it show  
  
I tell myself, that I can't hold out forever  
I say there is no reason for my fear  
Cause I feel so secure when we're together  
You give my life direction, you make everything so clear  
  
And even as I wonder I'm keeping you in sight  
You're a candle in the window on a cold dark winter's night  
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might  
  
And I can't fight this feeling anymore  
I've forgotten what I started fighting for  
It's time to bring this ship into the shore  
And throw away the oars forever  
Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore  
I've forgotten what I started fighting for  
And if I have to crawl upon the floor  
Come crashing through your door  
Baby I can't fight this feeling anymore  
  
My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you  
I've been running around in circles in my mind  
Baby it always seems that I'm following you  
Cause you take me to the places that alone I'd never find  
And even as I wonder I'm keeping you sight  
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night  
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might  
  
And I can't fight this feeling anymore  
I've forgotten what I started fighting for  
It's time to bring this ship into the shore  
And throw away the oars forever  
Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore  
I've forgotten what I started fighting for  
And if I have to crawl upon the floor  
Come crashing through your door  
Baby I can't fight this feeling anymore


If you come to me, that's all that I remember  
Come to me, before I fade away  
  
Here we are, how did we come so far  
Just tell me how you are, I need to know  
Night has come to see the senses run  
And every single one, we all must show  
  
And when you feel the flood upon the waters edge  
And take the leap from bitter sweet  
Do you believe, do you believe  
Do you still believe  
  
If you come to me, that's all that I remember  
Come to me, before I fade away  
If you come to me and wrap me in your splendour  
Come to me and let the music play  
  
In the sea of those eyes, in the fall of the rise  
There is no compromise  
  
If you come to me, that's all that I remember  
Won't you come to me, before I fade away  
If you come to me and wrap me in your splendour  
Come to me and let the music play  
Won't you come to me  
  


When she looks at me  
I know the girl sees things  
Nobody else can see  
  
All of the secret fears inside  
And all the craziness I hide  
She looks into my soul  
And reads me like nobody can  
  
And she doesn't judge the man  
She just takes me as I am  
  
[Chorus]  
Come what may, she believes  
And that faith is something  
I've never known before  
Come what may, she loves me  
And that love has helped me open a door  
Making me love myself a little more  
  
When I turn away  
She knows those are the times  
There's nothing she can say  
  
Nothing that anyone can do  
And so she lets me live it through  
And when I'm in my darkest hour of uncertainty  
She just simply lets me be  
And goes right on loving me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
And when it seems my dreams  
Have all slipped through my fingers  
When they just can't be found  
I turn around and there they are  
Shining in her eyes


When you are young, the thought of the day is  
Kill some rhyme and how many ways to break the rules.  
You laugh all the way, and grow up so fast that  
Everyone says this kind of life you live cannot last.  
And you smile as it's going past.  
Each morning arrives, and so much is new  
You can't wait to share it all with someone just like you.  
The telephone rings, and friends come around and talk to the night  
You see the world start to sing, and the fire inside you begins.  
  
There's nothing like crazy love, there's nothing at all  
Watching time, all the things that you need so much  
You can't explain the joy and pain of crazy love  
  
You live every day, as fast as it comes  
And don't count the cost because, there is no other way.  
These times will change, and people must grow but  
Until you do, you live the only life that you know  
And the wild fire lets you go.  
  
There's nothing like crazy love, it comes and it goes,  
Leaving you, with a feeling you never knew  
At first it lasts, and then it's past, it's crazy love.  
  
There's nothing like crazy love, there's nothing at all  
Watching time, all the things that you need so much  
You can't explain the joy and pain of crazy love


Hot sun as warm as the kissing of the wind  
Fooststeps in perfect time  
Heartbeat as loud as the whisper in the wood  
Hold me this dance is mine  
The dance is mine  
  
We are alone, your love excites me  
You are the earth moving inside me  
  
I feel like dancing with the mountain  
Feel the rhythm walking on air  
Feel like dancing with the mountain  
Feel the rhythm dancing with the mountain  
  
We climb up into the shelter of the sky  
Footsteps on higher ground  
Your voice as soft as a river running dry  
Hold me this dance is mine  
  
We are alone, your love's exciting me  
You are the earth, moving inside me  
  
I feel like dancing with the mountain  
Feel the rhythm walking on air  
Feel like dancing with the mountain  
Feel the rhythm dancing with the mountain  
  
I feel like dancing with the mountain  
Feel the rhythm walking on air  
Feel like dancing with the mountain  
Feel the rhythm dancing with the mountain  
  


Daybreak, I can't hide the truth  
It seems I'm not so strong  
And suddenly, there's no more to lose  
So where did I go wrong  
I should have known before  
Her love for me was gone  
  
Now I'm waiting for the light  
To fill this empty room  
I need you now to break through the night  
Whose shadows came too soon  
I waited far too long and now  
I feel I can't go on  
  
CHORUS  
Daybreak, oh daybreak  
I let her walk away  
I should have said, don't go  
I know I should have found another way  
Now I don't know what to do  
So daybreak, please break through  
  
Daybreak, I feel so alone  
Why won't you come to stay  
  
I waited far too long and now  
I feel I can't go on  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  


I used to watch you walk away  
Til the road you take would bend  
I was the man to turn you on  
And you knew it after all  
Come tomorrow when I'm all weary  
You would turn me down again  
At least that's the way I can remember  
  
Do it again, do it again  
Do it again, do it again  
  
Every little word you told me got home  
I'm still thinking about them  
Every little secret we could have known  
And we can't live without them  
  
You surely started something  
You surely gave me something new  
  
Do it again, do it again  
Do it again, do it again  
  
And I do think about you each now and then  
And each time it gets tighter  
From the road I can see the last break  
And my head's getting lighter  
  
Do it again, do it again (repeat)  


Do what you do cause you do it so well  
So stand in my way  
If only I knew what these eyes could not tell  
What this mouth could not say  
People are wrong but I'm right this time  
I'm losing bad friends fast  
Do what you do and keep it that way  
And this love will last  
  
Do what you do when your lights are turned down  
And you wake up afraid  
Think of the love that I have here for you  
And the wish will be made  
Only a cut of the deepest kind  
Could break what I hold for you  
I know the cut will never be mine  
So do what you do  
  
Waiting to put a foot in the door  
Hoping to learn what you're never sure  
Don't look too far it's here where you are  
  
Only a cut of the deepest kind  
Could break what I hold for you  
I know the cut will never be mine  
So do what you do


Does it matter if you're not sure  
You're never gonna see him anymore  
He's gone for good  
You might get mad at yourself  
You're doing your very best  
You can't do nothing else baby  
You've done the best you can  
There's been good times  
You know there have been reasons  
You still don't say you want somebody else  
You want somebody else  
I'm giving you just one more chance  
To recompense on my romance  
Can't believe there's been good times  
You know there have been reasons  
You still don't say you want somebody else  
You want somebody else  
  
I'm gonna stay with you baby  
Yes I will  
Stay with you baby  
Yes I will  
  
(Repeat)


When winter calls and the wind won't wait  
Look through the rain see the leaves start to break  
Once so alone like a prayer on the sea  
Nothing to hide, so much there to see  
Don't be afraid  
Don't be afraid  
The thoughts you wear like a long lost friend  
Are buried so deep that you can't see them end  
You know spring will come just as quick as you need  
And run straight to you when the dark nights are freed  
Don't be afraid  
Don't be afraid  
Don't be afraid  
Don't be afraid  


You were late last night, the candle burned so low  
And in my darkest hour I knew you had to go  
Did he hold you like I held you once before  
Is there someone else that loves you even more  
Don't tell me  
  
Standing face to face the words just fall away  
But in my loneliness I knew just what to say  
Did he touch you where I touched you long ago  
Please don't answer, I don't really want to know  
  
So don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
  
I have no more to give you  
I have no room to share  
I know the road I follow going nowhere  
  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
  
Should I close my eyes and say I'm giving up  
Can we compromise the darker side of love  
Did he hold you like I held you once before  
Since I lost your love I need you even more  
Don't tell me lies  
  
I have no more to give you  
I have no room to share  
I know the road I follow going nowhere  
  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me  
Don't tell me


We shared such a special love, it seem to have no end, but now it hurts me
just to remember,your eyes use to tell me so much..that words could never
find, and now you say, you don't know where your future lies but you got to
find it now or get left behind, don't turn me away I can't forget it all in
just one day take some time to speak your mind but say it's not over, don't
turn me away don't close the door on us this way I'm so sure that there's much
more you just have to tell me, remember those fights at nights it's not that
long ago, you said you wanted to stay there forever, I gave you the strength
of my hand when things were running low, I didn't know you would go back on
what you said, there must be some reasons there that you don't want to
share..don't turn me away, I can't forget it all in just one day take some
time to speak your mind but say it's not over...don't turn me away don't close
the door on us this way I'm so sure that there's much more you just have to
tell me...and just when you needed me, said I'd be there until the end, what
is it that's changed in you when all I want is to be your friend..I need a
friend...Don't turn me away...Don't turn me...Don't turn me away....Don't turn
me away...Don't turn me....Don't turn me away...Don't turn me away...Don't
turn me...Don't turn me away...Don't turn me...Don't turn me away...Don't turn
me away, take some time to speak your mind, but say it's not over..Don't turn
me awayy...takes some time to speak your mind, but say it's not over..Don't
turn me away,takes some time to speak your mind but say it's not overrrr!!


Why do I say, don't walk away  
You'll be the way you were before, when you don't want me anymore  
  
  
Don't turn around, don't ever leave, a lonely room where empty days  
Are gathering to meet me when you're gone, gone  
How in the world will I go on  
  
  
(Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay  
(Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay (don't walk away)  
  
  
Chorus:  
Don't walk away (don't walk away), don't say goodbye (don't say goodbye)  
Don't turn around (don't turn around), don't let it die (don't let it die)  
When shadows fall (when shadows fall), when day is done (when day is done)  
All through the night (all through the night), all of my life (all of my life)  
Don't walk away  
  
  
Is it a dream, when will it end  
When everything we've ever known has ended and I'm all alone  
  
  
Where will I go, where will I be, the feelings that I've never shown  
Maybe I'll find the answer when you're gone, gone  
How in the world will I go on  
  
  
(Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay  
(Don't walk away) all you gotta do is stay (don't walk away)  
  
  
Chorus repeats 3x


When you're out in front and your life is unsure  
What have you got goin' for you after every road you turn  
It's magic when you tell me and run your fingers through my hair  
I don't need your persuasion, 'cause I'm already there  
I've just read it through and I said to myself  
That's not really you, I'll keep myself to myself  
It's magic when you tell me, and write the words I want to see  
When I reach the last line, it's just empty for me  
I've been learning so long, about the things you do  
I've been learning so long about you, about you  
  
[Chorus]  
Empty pages I've read you all through  
Empty pages filled with spaces I fell in and I fell in  
Empty pages I've read you all through  
Empty pages filled with spaces I fell in and I fell in.


This will take some understanding  
I believe someone is sending love to us and everyone  
Who cares to take a gamble sometimes  
Think of me I've given all I can  
Stretched an arm and open hand to you  
  
So never say no  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
  
You I need, always needed, don't turn back for any reason  
First we talk and then we fall headfirst into each others thinking  
Please be where I'll always see you, life is short  
The twinkle of an eye is all we have until we say  
  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
  
Take me away, take me away  
Take me away  
Do you dream fantasy and believe what you see is weird  
I need a remedy or a book to get off this fear  
All I wanted to know is how do I get the truth from here.  
We play so small a part  
But we started from somewhere  
  
All the friends that I can think of  
Know what's going to happen to them  
If they don't think on today and plan ahead for their tomorrow  
Here we are just lucky children breaking out of the shell  
I'll take your hand today and love you till we reach  
  
The end of the line  
Reach the end of the line  
Reach the end of the line  
Reach the end of the line  
Take me away  
Take me away  
Take me away  
  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line  
That's the end of the line


I, I was the lonely one  
Wondering what went wrong, why love had gone  
And left me lonely  
I, I was so confused, feeling like I'd just been used  
Then you came to me and my loneliness left me  
  
I used to think I was tied to a heartache  
That was the heartbreak, but now that I've found you  
  
Even the nights are better  
Now that we're here together  
Even the nights are better  
Since I found you, oh  
Even the days are brighter  
When someone you love's beside ya  
Even the nights are better  
Since I found you  
  
You, you knew just what to do  
'Cause you had been lonely too  
And you showed me how  
To ease the pain and  
You did more than mend a broken heart  
'Cause now you've made a fire start  
And I, I can see that you feel the same way  
  
I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me  
Until you told me and now that I've found you  
Even the nights are better  
Now that we're here together  
Even the nights are better  
Since I found you, oh  
Even the days are brighter  
When someone you love's beside ya  
Even the nights are better  
Since I found you  
  
I never dreamed there'd be someone to hold me  
Until you told me and now that I've found you  
  
Even the nights are better  
Now that we're here together  
Even the nights are better  
Since I found you, oh  
Even the days are brighter  
When someone you love's beside ya  
Even the nights are better  
Since I found you


Every night seems, dinner and wine  
Saturdays, girls  
I was never in love, never had the time  
In my hustle and hurried world  
Laughing my self to sleep, waking up lonely  
I need someone to hold me, oh  
  
It's such a crazy home town  
It can drag you down  
Till you run out of dreams  
So you party all night to the music and lights  
But you don't what happiness means  
I was dancing in the dark with strangers  
No love around me  
When suddenly you found me, oh  
  
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me  
You're my fantasy, you're my reality  
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me  
You're everything I need, you're everything to me  
Oh girl  
  
Everything good, everything fine  
That's what you are  
So put your hand in mine and together we'll climb  
As high as the highest star  
I'm living the life time in every minute  
That we're together  
And I'm staying right here forever, oh  
  
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me  
You're my fantasy, you're my reality  
Girl, you're every woman in the world to me  
You're everything I need, you're everything to me  
Oh girl


When I look for the love in your eyes  
You turn away  
And there's nothing as loud as the words  
That we never say  
Look at us now  
Standing on the edge again  
It's not too late to try again  
I need some...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Evidence of love  
To keep on going  
Show me some evidence of love  
And I'll be here  
I still believe we can see this through  
There's only so much I can do  
And it doesn't make sense  
Without some evidence of love  
  
There's a frozen look on your face  
Is it saying goodbye  
'Cause there's nothing as cold as the ashes  
When the fire has died  
Talk to me now  
Tell me what you're missing  
Talk to me now  
And try to find your heart again  
I need some...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stand and fight  
Gotta say what's on your mind, baby  
So much is on the line  
Here's a chance to make it right  
  
Talk to me now  
Tell me what you're missing  
Talk to me now  
And try to find your heart again  
I need some...  
  
[Chorus]


You made a fool of me, but them broken dreams have got to end.  
  
Hey woman, you got the blues, cos' you ain't got no one else to use.  
There's an open road that leads nowhere, so just make some miles between here
and there.  
There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in,  
You took my body and played to win,  
Ha Ha woman it's a crying shame,  
But you ain't got no one else to blame.  
  
Chorus:  
E-evil Woman, E-evil Woman, E-evil Woman, Evil Woman  
  
Rolled in from another town,  
Hit some gold too hot to settle down,  
But a fool and his money soon go separate ways,  
And you found a fool lyin' in a daze,  
Ha Ha woman what you gonna do,  
You destroyed all the virtues that the Lord gave you,  
It's so good that you're feeling pain,  
But you better get yourself on board the very next train.  
  
Chorus  
  
Evil woman how you done me wrong,  
But now you're tryin' to wail a different song,  
Ha Ha funny how you broke me up, you made the wine now you drink the cup,  
I came runnin' every time you cried,  
Thought I saw love smilin' in your eyes,  
Ha Ha very nice to know, that you ain't got no place left to go.  
  
Chorus


Easy come and easy go  
Hard to get a hold on  
Searching for what you don't know  
Blind to where you belong  
Feel the power in your dreams  
Vision in your sight  
Nothing's dark as it may seem  
We can make it right  
  
[Chorus]  
I have faith  
In your love  
I have faith  
In your heart  
You don't need to hide from what you want  
You've just got to give it all you got  
The first thing that you need  
You got to have faith  
  
Truth hidden between the lies  
We both know the chances  
Nothing comes from compromise  
Only strength advances  
I will be here at your side  
For everything you do  
When the world tears at your pride  
I'll be there for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When the world's coming at you like a hungry alligator  
You got to have faith  
When you've got to pay them now or they'll take it from you later  
You got to have faith  
When you feel like the future's hiding on a distant cloud  
You got to have faith  
And you feel like shouting at the good Lord out loud  
You got to have faith  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When you know that you're ready but the time is not right  
You got to have faith  
And you lie awake staring at the ceiling all night  
You got to have faith


CLOSE YOUR EYES AND FILL THE SKIES  
WITH COTTON CANDY CLOUDS  
STEP INSIDE THE RAINBOW  
RIDE WHERE DRAGONFLIES SING LOUD  
COLORS FALLING, BUTTERFLIES AND FLOWERS  
PAINT THE GROUND  
CUCKOOS CALLING, DO I HAVE TO GO  
AND IT'S HARD, SO HARD TO FORGET HER  
  
THIS IS WHERE WE ALWAYS SAID  
THAT EVERYTHING IS REAL  
HANGING FROM A SPIDER'S WEB  
THE VALLEYS AND THE FIELDS  
FOLLOW ME INSIDE THE TREE  
AND CATCH ME IF YOU CAN  
SOMEONE ELSE IS PLAYING IN THE SAND  
AND IT'S HARD, SO HARD TO FORGET HER  
  


(graham russell)  
A long time ago, from the valley of the sun  
Came the holy power,  
When the gods were one  
Searching for a new home,  
Searching for this land  
Guided by the stars, and a vision they had seen  
The pillars of the temple,  
In these hills of green  
Buried deep inside for only us to find  
(chorus)  
It is the roar of the wind,  
The power of the sun  
The strength of a thousand bows  
And those who near it again, will fear it again  
And it's here in the heart of the rose  
Painted in the sky was the moment to awake  
All that lay within you,  
As this dawn should break  
With this force awoken, none can stand before  
This is the hour, now is the time  
Driven by the purest love, I give you mine  
All that we must be, is everything we see  
  
(chorus)  
Our love, has brought us both together  
And it's our love that will go on forever  
There is no love that can become as one  
Before it's time  
  
(chorus)  
It is the trees in the earth,  
It is the rivers that run  
And through us this secret flows  
And now our destiny calls,  
You'll remember it all  
Our love for the heart of the rose  


[Chorus]  
Here I am playing with those memories again  
And just when I thought time had set me free  
Those thoughts of you keep taunting me  
  
Holding you, a feeling I never outgrew  
Though each and every part of me has tried  
Only you can fill that space inside  
  
So there's no sense pretending  
My heart it's not mending  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just when I thought I was over you  
And just when I thought I could stand on my own  
Oh baby those memories come crashing through  
And I just can't go on without  
  
On my own I've tried to make the best of it alone  
I've done everything I can to ease the pain  
But only you can stop the rain  
  
I just can't live without you  
I miss everything about you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just when I thought I was over you  
And just when I thought I could stand on my own  
Oh baby those memories come crashing through  
And I just can't go on without  
Go on without  
It's just no good without you


Pictures of you race across my mind  
Filling all the space there is to find  
Melting love's own ice that lay so frozen  
I give that sacrifice for feeling chosen  
  
So if I face another day without you next to me  
I'll lock you in my mind and wish away the key  
  
CHORUS  
Hope springs eternal when you're near  
All the passion reappears  
All emotion seems so strong  
  
Hope springs eternal through your eyes  
Draws me closer to your side  
And keeps me there where I belong  
  
Given back the trust that was so fleeting  
Captured by one my heart was seeking  
Taken to my destiny's horizon  
Searching for the moon we see it rising  
  
And in the silence of the night, I hold you next to me  
Feeling dreams take flight, they set the spirit free  
  
CHORUS  
  


I've dance alone a thousand times  
To songs that no one else could even hear  
I've reached into the flame of love  
I couldn't hold it  
And it disappeared  
I've lived to learn to hate the blues  
I've lived with everything but you  
  
I can't believe my eyes  
I see you here  
Lookin' just the way you should  
Ooh  
So good, it's too good to be true  
I lived my life  
To be lyin' here with you  
ooh  
I can't believe my eyes  
  
I've felt the empty hands of time  
As they were stealin' all my life away  
I've heard the silence here inside  
Waiting for words that lovers  
Could not say  
You turn a little into stone  
With every night you spend alone  
  
I can't believe my eyes  
I see you here  
Lookin' just the way you should  
Ooh  
So good, it's too good to be true  
I lived my life  
To be lyin' here with you  
Ooh  
Still, when I see you lyin' here  
I can't believe my eyes


Every since feeling now would take my life into a year ago  
You say you love me again  
I can't say what I cannot do  
It's been too long without someone  
How could you let me sink this far away from you  
Now you're here wondering why you can't get near  
  
I can't get excited, can't get excited  
There's a thousand things to do  
I can't do anything with you  
I can't get excited, can't get excited  
You can see me look right through  
I don't feel like I used to do  
  
I'm turning back the pages now  
I pleaded with you all so many times  
Trying just to make you see  
Hoping that I might be the one  
So come down love me and it'll be alright  
The time to bring back love is not tonight  
I never thought I'd have to say  
that you should leave and go your way  
  
I can't get excited, can't get excited  
There's a thousand things to do  
I can't do anything with you  
I can't get excited, can't get excited  
You can see me look right through  
I don't feel like I used to do  
  
Not in love, still not in love with you  
Not in love, I'm still not in love with you  
Not in love, still not in love with you  
Not in love  
  
Tell me why you can't leave me lonely  
Tell me why I'm taking a chance on you  
Taking a chance on you  
Taking a chance on you  
Taking a chance on you  
  
I can't get excited, can't get excited  
There's a thousand things to do  
I can't do anything with you  
I can't get excited, can't get excited  
You can see me look right through  
I don't feel like I used to do  
  
Can't get excited, I can't get excited  
You can see me look right through  
I don't feel like I use to do  
Can't get excited, I can't get excited  
There's a thousand things to do  
I can't do anything with you  
I can't get excited, can't get excited


I have the ring that needs your finger  
I want you always to remember  
I want you to be a part of my dreams  
I was so lonely here without you  
I was so cold just like a statue  
Being with you has made me complete  
  
I can feel your loving touch inside me  
I can hear you whispering you want to stay close to me  
  
Every day and every night  
I never thought your love could feel so right  
Every day and through the night  
Let me be the one to hold you tight  
I can't let go  
I can't let go  
I can't let to  
You're a part of me, don't you know  
  
Would you give me just a lifetime  
I'll stand beside you through the years that come and go  
Nothing at all could stand in our way  
  
I can feel your answer deep inside me  
I can hear you whispering you want to stay close to me  
  
Every day and every night  
I never thought your love could feel so right  
Every day and through the night  
Let me be the one to hold you tight  
I can't let go  
I can't let go  
I can't let to  
You're a part of me, don't you know


I come alive (date with an Angel)  
  
Everyday I prayed that I would find a lover  
Then I looked into your eyes and I discovered  
Something was changing in my life  
Turning the darkness into light  
  
When I'm with you I come alive  
I feel I'm living in heaven  
You make the wrong turn out so right  
I'm gonna love you forever  
  
There is not a thing that I would change about you  
And my life was never quite the same without you  
You made the rain clouds go away  
Bringing me sunshine everyday  
  
When I'm with you I come alive  
I feel I'm living in heaven  
You make the wrong turn out so right  
I'm gonna love you forever  
  
In your arms you make me warm  
You give me strength to carry on  
I know I won't be alone  
As long as I'm with you


Who are we to say who we must obey  
to get much better, ooh to get much better,  
Who are we to say there's only one way to read the letter,  
A decision to make and here I must be sure  
it will not break me,  
Not a friend in the place to say to my face  
if I'm right or if I'm wrong.  
  
Who are we to say what we must throw away,  
it doesn't matter, ooh it doesn't matter  
This is for me, this is for you,  
it's not inspiring it's not the right thing  
I can't accept some things,  
irrespective of how long you tell me  
You can make me give in but that's because  
I'm stronger than I should be.  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't believe you, I don't believe the things you say  
There's another way, I can choose to take  
There's another way and it's for me to make  
  
When there's a voice to tell you the choice,  
you will remember, ooh you will remember  
Know what to take, what decisions to make without thinking  
I can't accept some things,  
I never will say yes when I don't mean to,  
You am make me give in but that's because  
I'm happy when I'm with you.  
  
[Chorus]


(graham russell)  
I called on you today  
I know it's late to say I'm sorry  
There's so much on my mind  
I feel as though the time is upon me  
Do you know you take my heart through the door  
Are there words to tell you what I live for  
(chorus)  
I don't want to lose you  
I don't want to lose you  
I don't want to lose you  
  
Let me dry your eyes  
Is this the last time I can hold you?  
There's hope in this soul  
And words that will tread where you go to  
  
Is it true, you are leaving what you believe  
Part of you, will always be with me  
  
(chorus)  
You have the hand that I need to get by  
Understand what it is that's turning me down  
  
(chorus)  
Is it true, you are leaving what you believe  
Part of you, will always be with me  
  
(chorus)  


I just like the feeling  
You give me when the time is right  
I just like the feeling  
When you tell me you'll be here tonight  
Let me believe that this moment is good for you too  
When you leave it's not really all through  
Does it get to you  
I just like the feeling  
Of pretending that some day you'll stay  
I just like the feeling  
That your love is not too far away  
Tell me again  
That you'll stay for as long as you can  
When I'm really not part of the plan  
  
I just like the feeling  
I just like the feeling  
I just like the feeling  
Closest to love  
  
I just like the feeling  
When you're next to me without a sound  
I just like the feeling  
When you tell me that you're all unwound  
  
One night I'm yours and tonight  
You can have nothing less  
Tomorrow I long for the rest  
Tell me a lie  
If it helps me get through one more day  
You know I'll be here anyway  
  
I just like the feeling  
I just like the feeling  
I just like the feeling  
Closest to love  
  
One night I'm yours and tonight  
You can have nothing less  
Tomorrow I long for the rest  
Tell me a lie  
If it helps me get through one more day  
You know I'll be here anyway  
  


(graham russell)  
You didn't have to be so mad  
When you ran across the road  
The light alone soon told me  
You had a heavy load  
But I can't see why you didn't stay  
Why you didn't come to see if I felt  
The same way  
And I do, and I do  
I never asked for any comfort  
To take up your time  
But now I feel so very different  
I need to make you mine  
And I want to take what you have to  
Give me  
And bring you the words that fall  
From my head  
And I will, and I will  
I know you better than you think  
And always will  
Know you better than you think  
And always will, always will  
I know you better than you think  
And always will, always will  


I've been staring at the floor  
And I've been holding back the tears  
And I'd been talking to the walls  
If the walls had ears  
  
And now it seems that every time  
I look into your eyes  
There is only so far I can see  
  
[Chorus:]  
So take me back there  
Where only we can go  
When you touch me the memories unfold  
And I remember love  
I remember love  
Do you remember love?  
  
I've been looking to the future  
And I've been dreaming of our past  
But now I'm counting on this moment  
'Cause it may be the last  
  
And days go by and still I try  
To reach into your soul  
There is only so far I can go  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Remember the times when our world was alive  
And all of the answers were clear  
Remember the times when our souls would ignite  
And passion explodes into fears  
  
And I remember love  
I remember love  
Do you remember love?


Hard as a diamond's eye  
Soft as a last goodbye  
These are the things we learn to be  
  
Calm as a distant light  
That shines on an island night  
These are the thoughts that say:  
It's not too late to tell you,  
I know I wanna tell you  
  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna be there to catch you from falling  
  
Cold as the arctic ice  
Hot as a passion's rise  
These are the days I spend alone  
Pure as an infant's heart  
That beats through the light and dark  
These are the pictures of you  
Always getting closer  
I wanna hold you closer  
  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna be there when love starts calling  
  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna be there to catch you from falling  
  
I only wish my heart  
Could fly like it does  
When I sit and dream  
I'll never wake again  
As I hold you tenderly  
My thoughts were real  
And being with you now is the only  
Thought that's strong,  
It's a lonely night, and I'm trying  
To hold on...  
  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna be there when love starts calling  
  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna hold you tonight  
I wanna be there to catch you from falling  
  


Here I am again  
I've come to see you smile  
I know you understand  
I have to say again  
It's only for awhile  
  
And still you're always here  
Just waiting for my call  
I wish I knew a Way  
To give more than I do  
I want to give it all  
  
CHORUS  
It doesn't happen every day  
But it happened to me once before  
Those early years I threw away  
Now I only have to hear your voice  
To make me feel so sure  
That your love is why  
I want to give it all  
  
Don't the minutes fly  
And hours just seem so few  
With days apart so long  
It's hard to spend my time  
When I'm so far from you  
  
And still you're always there  
Just waiting for my call  
I wish I knew a way  
To give more than I do  
I want to give it all


If it's love that you want, there will always be someone  
If it's love that you need, I can lay here at your feet  
When your fingers want to hold someone close to you  
Oh, don't you know baby  
  
I want you...  
When it's time to begin, you can tell me, let me in  
Every moment, every day, I'll be waiting every way  
'Til you're here next to me and you want me too  
  
Oh, don't you want, baby I know you  
I want you...  
If it's love that you want, there will always be someone  
If it's love that you need and you want me too  
  
Don't you want, baby I know you  
Breathe in my love, breathe out your love  
Before its too late, too late  
I want you...


Stay with me only if your heart is free,  
There's no sense if we can't see beyond how we feel.  
Honestly, how do we know what we need?  
What can we believe?, help me to know this is real.  
(CHORUS)  
If I give it all, if I give it all away.  
We could have it all, we could have it all this way.  
I should have said what I was thinking  
Followed my heart, but it was sinking.  
If you love me say that you love me,  
I'll say I love you too.  
If you love me say that you need me,  
I'll give my love to you.  
Broken dreams are never really what they seem,  
Somewhere in between you can give all your troubles to me.  
I don't know how far we are meant to go,  
If you tell me so that is where I want to be.  
(CHORUS)  
If I give it all, if I give it all away.  
We could have it all, we could have it all this way.  
I should have said what I was thinking  
Followed my heart, but it was sinking.  
If you love me say that you love me,  
I'll say I love you too.  
If you love me say that you need me,  
I'll give my love to you.  
If you love me say that you love me,  
I'll say I love you too.  
If you love me say that you need me,  
I'll give my love to you.  
I'll give my love to you.  
  


When the sun sets on the ocean  
When the yellow touches the blue  
When your heart begins to open  
I'll be so close to you  
  
When you're dreaming and I hold you  
Remember that dream will come true  
When you wake up and you need me  
You'll know just what to do  
  
In the winter when it's raining  
And the sun can never shine through  
All those days of endless waiting  
I'll be thinking of you  
  
When thunder breaks the dawn  
When all muy strength is gone  
When shadows disappear  
I'll still be holding on  
  
When then sun sets on the ocean  
When the yellow touches the blue  
When your heart begins to open  
I'll be so close to you  
  
When you're dreaming and I hold you  
Remember that dream will come true  
When you wake up and you need me  
You'll know just what to do  
  
In the winter when it's raining  
And the sun can never shine through  
When your heart begins to open  
When your heart begins to open  
When your heart begins to open  
  
I'll be thinking of you  
  


We give, we take, we bend until we break  
We touch and feel, to hurt or heal  
And in the end  
  
We run so far from who we really are  
And we starve and thirst, we praise and curse  
And I don't care  
  
How near or far, I'll find you, wherever you are  
You know I'll find you, wherever you go  
  
We shout and scream, but it's just a silly dream  
And we hold it inside like its live or die  
Till in the end we learn to wait  
And we squeeze the hands of fate  
And we twist and turn  
We freeze and burn, but I don't care  
  
How near or far, I'll find you, wherever you are  
You know I'll find you, wherever you go  
Through the time and space  
I'll always see your face  
And if I must count every star  
  
How near or far, I'll find you, wherever you are  
You know I'll find you, wherever you go  
  


All last night we lay in bed making love  
I never felt so much before with anyone  
Never had to say a word  
It was all right there  
The warmth inside us flamed and circled everywhere  
  
And if I never have another love  
Well at least I had last night  
Now I know how the feeling grows  
Cause you made me come alive  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll never get enough, never get enough  
Never get enough of you  
I'll never get enough, never get enough  
Never get enough of you  
I only want to give you more  
  
Now you're gone, I'm all alone just lying here  
Waiting for the moment when I'll feel you near  
Never asked if you'd come back,  
I was too damn proud  
I just smile and touched your hair  
As you went out  
  
[Chorus]


I'm alive - and the world shines for me today  
I'm alive - suddenly I am here today  
Seems like forever (and a day), thought I could never (feel this way)  
Is this really me? I'm alive, I'm alive  
  
  
I'm alive - and the dawn breaks across the sky  
I'm alive - and the sun rises up so high  
Lost in another world (far away), never another word (till today)  
But what can I say? I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive  
  
  
(Instrumental break)  
  
  
Suddenly came the dawn (from the night), suddenly I was born (into light)  
How can it be real? I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive  
  
  
I'm alive - and the world shines for me today  
I'm alive - suddenly I am here today  
Seems like forever (and a day), thought I could never (feel this way)  
Is this really me? I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive  
  
  
(Instrumental break)  
  
  
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive


(graham russell)  
  
All my life I've been a manual man  
I like the floor all the power in my hand  
Driving up and down the road all day  
Overtaking anything in the way  
Alongside us came a man in a grin  
Winding down the window clever again  
You know manual is far too old  
To keep pace then he left us cold  
  
It's automatic, it's automatic  
It's automatic, it goes by itself  
  
  
Quick thinking and a mutual aim  
So on finding out the name of the game  
A different unit was ordered that day  
Who wants to go thru' the gears anyway  
The same color the same design  
The same car with a different mind  
Knowing now we wouldn't take second place  
Both saying with a smile on our face.


Take the river to the highest mountain  
Take the ocean to the farthest sea  
I'd take back everything I've said to hurt you  
If you'd come back to me  
  
I'd bring you fire from the frozen waters  
Leave a flower 'neath a fallen tree  
I'd take back everything I said to scare you  
Away from me  
  
Two hands can feel so much more  
That's what I'm loving you for  
I was too blind to see fear was inside of me  
I'm not afraid anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
It's never too late, it's never too late  
To forgive and forget  
Tell me that it isn't over, tell me that it isn't over  
I'll never hold you again  
  
If a broken wing can still be mended  
Then a foolish heart can still be true  
Take the river to the highest mountain  
That's where I'll wait for you  
  
Two hearts can feel so much more  
That's what I'm loving you for  
The man that you tried to free  
Is still locked inside of me  
And your heart must open the door  
  
[Chorus]


And the money she gave me, wasn't enough to pay the rent,  
But before I get some all my money's long been spent,  
It's nice to get away from all the noise back home  
It's harmless in a way we don't have that far to go.  
  
And in June we're three,  
And it's nice, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you.  
With the rain came freedom, never was one more word so true  
In the ragged morning then the word came alive in you  
  
And I tried, and I tried for you  
It's not easy, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you.  
All the food that we could buy wasn't enough to keep just one alive.  
But we came through summer letting autumn close your eyes.  
  
And I tried, and I tried for you.  
I can take it, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you.  
It's not easy, 'cause I love you, 'cause I love you, that's all.


I stand alone I'm just a face in the crowd  
I get lonely if the truth be said  
Sometimes I want to cry out loud  
But I try to understand instead  
I wish I had the strength inside to walk  
Right up to you  
I'd never have to hide behind these  
Doubts I know are true  
  
It's not too late to fall in love  
Accept your fate I'm the one you're  
Thinking of  
It's not too late so don't run away  
I need you too, but it's hard for me  
So hard for me to say  
  
So I listen for the perfect moment  
To rush to you but my heart's too slow  
Everybody here can see me stumble  
Better wait until the lights get low  
Wish I had the strength inside to walk  
Right up to you  
I wouldn't have to hide behind these  
Doubts I know are true  
  
It's not too late to fall in love  
Accept your fate I'm the one your  
Thinking of  
It's not too late so don't run away  
I need you too  
  
But it's hard for me  
Yes it's hard for me  
Yes it's hard for me  
So hard for me to say  
  
It's not too late to fall in love  
Accept your fate I'm the one you're  
Thinking of  
It's not too late so don't run away  
I need you too, but it's hard for me  
So hard for me to say


I've got your love I don't now how we did it  
I don't know why it seemed so long  
I've got your love I don't know why you hid it  
I've never felt like this before  
  
I won't fall in love  
You said it so sure  
You haven't noticed you never say that any more  
  
I've got your love  
And it's a perfect reason for understanding life some more  
  
Burnt your fingers before  
Burnt your finger before  
  
I've got your love I don't know how we did it  
I don't know why it seemed so long  
I've got your love it's such a total feeling  
I don't know where it all began  
  
I won't fall in love  
You said it so sure  
You haven't noticed you never say that any more  
  
I've got your love  
And if I lose all others  
It wouldn't really hurt at all  
I've got your love I don't know how we did it  
I don't know why it seemed so long  
  
I've got your love I've got your love  
I don't know why it seemed so long


Just another woman  
In my life  
Just another woman  
Lost in the night  
Just another woman  
Keepin' in touch with a man  
  
Knock upon my window  
Late at night making me believe  
that something's not right  
I look through the window but all I can see  
Is the rain  
Standing on my doorstep  
Not very old looking so helpless  
And looking so cold  
A woman in need of some help  
Most have lost her way  
  
She was tall  
She was lost  
She could smile  
And her words got crossed  
  
Just another woman  
In my life  
Just another woman  
Lost in the night  
Just another woman  
Keepin' in touch with a man  
  
As we sat by the fire  
The flame just grew  
Talking about just the things we knew  
Watching a new day arise outside my room  
The more I listened the more she told  
And in fascination my heart was sold  
Weaving in and out of my mind  
With a skidder off now  
  
She was tall  
She was lost  
She could smile  
And her words got crossed  
  
Just another woman  
In my life  
Just another woman  
Lost in the night  
Just another woman  
Keepin' in touch with a man


I've had a lot of big dreams  
I've made a lot of bad moves  
I know you could walk away  
But you never do  
  
I've met a lot of cold hearts  
I've learned to smile and deceive  
I know I'm hard to be around  
But you never leave  
  
I'm not easy to understand  
But you hold out your hand  
  
And you say you love me  
Just as I am  
You always treat me  
The best that you can  
You say you want me, need me  
Love me baby  
Just as I am, just as I am  
  
I've made a lot of heartaches  
I've found a lot of closed doors  
When all the others turn away  
You love me more  
You love me more  
  
I'm not easy to understand  
But you hold out your hand  
  
And you say you love me  
Just as I am  
You always treat me  
The best that you can  
You say you want me, need me  
Love me baby  
Just as I am, just as I am  
  
I want to love forever  
To keep our world together  
And be the best that I can be  
Baby, every time the world  
Caves in on me  
  
And you say  
Just as I am  
You always treat me  
The best that you can  
You say you want me, need me  
Love me baby  
Just as I am, just as I am  


(graham russell)  
I'll always need a friend  
One I can defend  
All I've got to give  
Is do you want to live  
With me every day till I pass away  
I've been sitting here  
Frightened stiff with fear  
Love has brought it on  
And it must go on  
Being here with you,  
Taking what is mine  
Just between the lines  
And here we are, here we are  
All alone for me to take  
And here you are, here you are  
All alone for me to take  
Fell in love today  
Little words to say  
Let us close the door  
That's what doors are for  
Being here with you  
Taking what is mine  
Just between the lines  
I'll always need a friend  
One I can defend  
All I've got to give  
Is do you want to live  
Being here with you  
Taking what is mine  
Just between the lines  


I'm late again, oh how the evening flies  
You meet old friends and share the secrets they hide  
It's not like me, to be this much unconcerned  
The drinks are free, I know this time I will bur  
  
You know you must believe me, it's so good to see you here.  
I really tried to get away, it seems like it's been years  
I wish you could've warned me, you act like it's the end  
Ooooooohhhh, I'm late again  
  
So I get home, and nothing there seems the same.  
I'm walking slow, and no one remembers my name  
I bring a smile, and, saying I'm losing my mind  
I realize that you've been wasting my time  
  
You know you must believe me, it's so good to see you here  
I really tried to get away, it seems like it's been years  
I wish you could've warned me, you act like it's the end  
Oooohhhhh, I'm late again....Yeah....  
  
REPEAT CHORUS  
  
No one home, yes I'm late again.....  
Our love, guess I'll wait again.....  
  
REPEAT  


(graham russell)  
  
As long as I live all that I receive is what I want to give to you  
I know that if I can stay for a while you will soon love me too  
Let's take a chance at least we'll learn a lesson  
It beats hanging round waiting for moments that wait into days  
I don't want to love you in two different ways  
  
Do you want to give, do you want to give me you whole day and more  
Do you want to give, do you want always the key to the door  
It's easy for you talking your way out of all situations  
When you can't see thru' and leave it up to me  
And that's what I do  
And that's what I do  
  
  
Love comes to me and leaves me with you  
Love runs thru' me in all that you do  
Don't walk away, don't leave me standing here  
That's not the way, don't lead me anywhere  
I need you now, I need you now  
Don't leave me standing here  
Oh, I don't know, I just don't know  
It's much too fast for me can't we go slow  
Oh, I don't know, I just don't know  
What do you want me to do


Love conquers time without fear, without proof  
It will rise it will strike in your name  
Love conquers time like the light from the moon  
It must never be taken in vain  
  
So when you feel the beat is gone  
The love you give away will carry on  
  
Love conquers time just like tears in the sand  
It will change with each direction you try  
Love conquers time from the moment you fall  
To those arms like a child you will fly  
  
So when you feel the beat is gone  
The love you give away will carry on  
It will carry on  
  
Seasons rise and fall from a silent command  
Beyond that place of our forever  
The road goes on to where it can never end  
  
Love conquers time without fear, without proof  
It will rise it will strike in your name  
Love conquers time like the light from the moon  
It must never be taken in vain  
  
Love conquers time just like tears in the sand  
It will change with each direction you try  
Love conquers time from the moment you fall  
To those arms like a child you will fly  
  


When we come into this world  
And we hunger for the touch  
From the one that brought us life  
From the one that gave so much  
  
Innocence will take your hand  
And speak through the one thought in your mind  
  
Don't you know that love is all  
Love is where we all begin  
And when we knock on heaven's door  
Only love will let us in  
  
And as we gather to ourselves  
A part of everything we see  
We realize that what we own  
Isn't what we really need  
  
Innocence take my hand  
And speak through the one thought in your mind  
  
Don't you know that love is all  
Love is where we all begin  
Love is all that we must do  
It is the reason why we live  
Love is all I have for you  
  
True love cannot be broken  
Through all the tears of pain  
Only one truth survives,  
Only one truth remains  
  


So many miles it seems  
Nothing can come between, your life and mine  
Before the ink is dry  
I feel just you and I, inside my mind  
  
Love is the arrow, fly straight and true  
Into this deep and fallow hart  
What am I to do  
What am I to do  
  
Another world to spin  
A distant tide come in, they always do  
A mother holds the son  
A lover waits alone, like me for you  
  
Love is the arrow, fly straight and true  
Into this deep and fallow hart  
What am I to do, what am I to do  
  
Into the highest cloud  
Before a word is spoken  
Beyond the slighest doubt  
Before the dream is woken  
  


I want you to brighten the days of my life  
I want you and I all alone to be together at night  
  
I can't stand it  
The feeling when you're far away  
I want to wrap you up in my little world  
So you'll be here today  
  
When we fly through the night  
Can't you feel the rush of 1,000 dancers  
come into your life  
I'll be there to make it right  
  
If something is wrong, I'll make it right  
If something is wrong, I'll make it right  
  
I want you to put your trust in me  
Say goodbye to all your heartaches as fast as you can  
I need you to surrender to me all your body and soul  
And the spirit we seek will enter us both and make us complete  
  
When we fly through the night  
And it feels like heaven's wings we're riding  
You've got to hold on tight  
If you feel like I do  
Knowing nothing can go wrong between us  
I'll be there to make it right, make it right  
  
Know me, show me  
All your love  
You're here today  
You know you're here always  
You know I can't get enough  
You know I can't get enough  
  
If something is wrong, I'll make it right  
If something is wrong, I'll make it right


I know just how to whisper  
And I know just how to cry  
I know just where to find the answers  
And I know just how to lie  
I know just how to fake it  
And I know just how to scheme  
I know just when to face the truth  
And then I know just when to dream  
And I know just where to touch you  
And I know just what to prove  
I know when to pull you closer  
And I know when to let you loose  
And I know the night is fading  
And I know the time's gonna fly  
And I'm never gonna tell you everything I've gotta tell you  
But I know I've gotta give it a try  
And I know the roads to riches  
And I know the ways to fame  
I know all the rules and then I know how to break 'em  
And I always know the name of the game  
But I don't know how to leave you  
And I'll never let you fall  
And I don't know how you do it  
  
Making love out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all  
Making love out of nothing at all  
  
Everytime I see you all the rays of the sun are  
Streaming through the waves in your hair  
And every star in the sky is taking aim at  
Your eyes like a spotlight  
The beating of my heart is a drum, and it's lost  
And it's looking for a rhythm like you  
You can take the darkness from the pit of the night  
And turn into a beacon burning endlessly bright  
I've gotta follow it 'cause everything I know  
Well, it's nothing 'til I give it to you  
I can make the runner stumble  
I can make the final block  
And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle  
I can make all the stadiums rock  
I can make tonight forever  
Or I can make it disappear by the dawn  
And I can make you every promise that has ever been made  
And I can make all your demons be gone  
But I'm never gonna make it without you  
Do you really want to see me crawl  
And I'm never gonna make it like you do  
  
Making love out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all  
Out of nothing at all, out of nothing at all


I was thinking about miracles  
When you were fast asleep  
Of all the things we tried to find  
It's only love we keep  
And I don't ever want to wake you  
Your dreams are taking you so far  
It's there that I can always touch you  
For love is where you are  
(CHORUS)  
Fall upon me, take love from me  
Nothing is more beautiful to see  
Walk beside me, grow inside me  
All I have, you gave to me  
Each day another miracle  
That time can never take  
If time should come to claim you now  
He knows it's much too late  
So let the gates of dawn fly open  
And cast your light for all to see  
The chains of morning now are broken  
And you are drifting into me  
CHORUS (x2)  
  


Love I'll help you to see  
The world is ours it used to be  
But now it's changed so much  
We have to change it back  
Soon will be a day  
When just a look will be to say  
Let's break away today  
Let's start again I'll tell you where  
I'll tell you when  
You came from out of the air  
And wrapped in fire  
  
Said don't you be scared  
Can't you use your life  
To save so many more  
Cast my pride away  
And had me born again that very day  
And now I'm so alive  
I'm comin' through  
They're teaching me to tell it to you  
  
Oh I'm more the natural  
Way to be  
It's the natural remedy  
With the natural guarantee  
  
Oh your hearts would say  
My mind is gone  
And ran away  
But who's the loser if you don't know  
What I have  
A job that's hard to beat  
Looking out for holey feet  
Treading softly on the ground  
Making waves but not a sound  
  
Oh I'm more the natural  
Way to be  
It's the natural remedy  
With the natural guarantee  
  


Mother said, don't leave me  
There are monsters at the door  
I put on all my armour  
But I couldn't find my sword  
But there'll always be tomorrow  
Just you wait and see  
If they come to take you prisoner  
I'll be there to set you free  
  
Mother said, I'm grown up  
In a Sunday shirt and tie  
As long as I can see you  
Can I hold you when I cry  
There'll always be tomorrow  
I'll be so big and strong  
I'll sleep with all the lights out  
Not afraid of anyone  
  
I need you to stay  
I need you to stay  
I need you  
I need you  
  
Mother said she's sleeping  
So I climbed back into bed  
But the monsters took her prisoner  
That's all that father said  
So I thought about tomorrow  
And I learned to be alone  
Making friends with shadows  
As they moved around my home  
  
Mother never leaves me  
I can always see her smile  
  
I sit here in the evening  
To talk to her awhile  
There'll always be tomorrow  
Just you wait and see  
I know that any moment  
She will come to set me free  
  
I need you to stay  
I need you to stay  
I need you  
I need you  
  
I need you to stay  
I need you to stay  
I need you  
I need you  
  


You're here looking like my best friend  
Hoping you'll find a way  
To tell me you just can't stay  
  
You laughed hard at the world, I know  
Now that the seasons show  
To tell me, love, your heart will soon mend  
  
We counted everyday  
Only to show we needed each other  
Who needs a reason to love  
When friends just seem to know  
They know it  
  
You have lots of dreams, I know  
Now it's the close of the show  
Let's hope it'll all passes by in the end  
So get yourself along  
You're my best friend


I know you're leaving  
I won't ask you to stay  
I won't hold you back  
I won't stand in your way  
If that's what you've gotta do, I understand  
It's not that easy setting you free  
But that's how it's gotta be  
And as you're walking away  
As I'm watching you go  
There's one thing I want you to know  
Just remember my heart's with you  
When the night gets so long and cold  
And no ones there to hold and you're all alone  
Take a moment to think of me  
And the love that we used to know  
And if you ever find you ever need me someday  
I'm just a heartbeat away  
Saying goodbye isn't saying were through  
Just know through it all I'm still here for you  
Light a light in the window  
When your lost in the dark, ooh  
These arms would be happy to hold you again  
If ever you miss me or when you  
Start thinking about  
All the nights that we shared  
Darling, you know Ill be there  
Just remember my heart's with you  
When the night gets so long and cold  
And no ones there to hold and you're all alone  
Take a moment to think of me  
And the love that we used to know  
And if you ever find you ever need me someday  
You walk to the door with nothing to say  
I look in your eyes and you look away  
You're leaving me now, but darling, I hope  
Hope that you'll look back someday  
And remember my hearts with you  
When the night gets so long and cold  
And no one's there to hold when you're all alone  
Baby, take a moment to think of me  
And the love that we used to know  
And if you ever find that you're all alone  
Just remember my heart's with you  
When the night gets so long and cold  
And no ones there to hold and you're all alone  
Take a moment to think of me  
And the love that we used to know  
And if you ever find that you're all alone  


Walking along the boulevard  
Speaking into the air  
Where can I find the life  
I know that only dreams can share  
I close my eyes and see you there  
Calling me far beyond  
Wrapped in a robe of mystery  
You wave your magic wand  
  
Maybe it's real, only life is illusion  
Don't break my heart  
Hold out your hand, and I'll never lose you  
Don't break my heart  
  
Yes, I'm a man, and just flesh and bone  
But you do not love, all my dreams are your home  
I stare through a veil, so thin yet so near  
And walk in your footsteps, as you  
Cast off my fear  
  
Walk with me through the gates of time, to eternity  
And our love, will never fade away  
  
We can fly to a bridge across the sky  
Where the souls that would always cry  
Will never fade away  
  
Walking along the boulevard  
Wishing we were complete  
Why are some things so very hard to witness and believe  
  
The victor of this universe  
The victim of the wind  
Where does a dream begin and end  
And where does life begin  
  
Maybe it's real, only life is illusion  
Don't break my heart  
Hold out your hand, and I'll never lose you  
Don't break my heart  
  
Yes, I'm a man, and just flesh and bone  
But you do not love, all my dreams are your home  
I stare through a veil, so thin yet so near  
And walk in your footsteps, as you  
Cast off my fear  
  
Walk with me through the gates of time, to eternity  
And our love, will never fade away  
  
We can climb to a bridge across the sky  
Where the souls that would always cry  
Will never fade away  
  
We can climb to a bridge across the sky  
Where the souls that would always cry  
Will never fade away  
  


(graham russell)  
I never saw it happen  
I never saw the flame  
I never new how much there was  
To lose and gain  
But when the sun was taken  
You never shone so bright  
And from a place we'd long forgotten  
The blind were given sight  
If there's one thing I must do  
It's to say I love you to  
It's the one thing I'm so sure of  
(chorus)  
If I hold you now from my point of view  
Will you show me how to be close to you  
If the dawn should break and you're  
Far away  
Can you ever know what I need to say  
I can see how much I was taking it all  
For granted  
Among the silent victims  
Only the wind would moan  
And for a time I felt us touch  
The great unknown  
For that eternal moment  
Oh what a price to pay  
With nothing left but all we have  
We slowly walked away  
If there's one thing I must do  
It's to say I love you too  
It's the one thing I'm so sure of  
  
(chorus)  
So give life to your dreams  
For there lies your survival  
And cast your heart beyond those  
Faded scenes  
And I'll bring you through that storm  
Yes I'll bring you back  
  
(chorus)  
News from nowhere  
News from nowhere  
News from nowhere...  


If I had to live my life without you near me  
The days would all be empty  
The nights would seem so long  
With you I see forever oh so clearly  
I might have been in love before  
But it never felt this strong  
Our dreams are young and we both know  
They'll take us where we want to go  
Hold me now, touch me now  
I don't want to live without you  
  
Chorus:  
Nothing's gonna change my love for you  
You ought to know by now how much I love you  
One thing you can be sure of  
I'll never ask for more than your love  
Nothing's gonna change my love for you  
You ought to know by now how much I love you  
The world may change my whole life through  
But nothing's gonna change my love for you  
  
If the road ahead is not so easy  
Our love will lead a way for us  
Like a guiding star  
I'll be there for you if you should need me  
You don't have to change a thing  
I love you just the way you are  
So come with me and share the view  
I'll help you see forever too  
Hold me now, touch me now  
I don't want to live without you  
  
Chorus


When love is new  
And the world is out reaching for you  
We try hard to hold it all  
In our hands  
But it slips through  
Like soft drifting sands  
But drying the tears  
Can build it all like new  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now and forever  
Remember the words  
From my heart will always be true  
Now and forever  
Together and all that I feel  
Here's my love for you  
  
Learning each day  
That the right time was so far away  
To tell you the things I knew  
Now it's clear  
That the moment  
We searched for is here  
And counting the years  
Is all I want to do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hold me as close  
As love will allow  
Until all your fears are gone  
What has all passed  
Is over now  
I'm here with you  
I'm here with you  
I'm holding on  
I'm holding on  
Is my love for you  
  
[Chorus]


O come all ye faithful  
Joyful and triumphant  
O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem  
Come and behold him  
Born the King of Angels  
  
O come let us adore him, O come let us adore him  
O come let us adore him, Christ the Lord  
  
Sing choirs of angels  
Sing in exaltation  
Oh sing all ye citizens of Heaven above  
Glory to God  
All glory in the highest  
  
O come let us adore him, O come let us adore him  
O come let us adore him, Christ the Lord  
  
Yeah Lord we greet thee  
Born this happy morning  
O Jesus to thee be all glory given  
Word of the Father  
Now in flesh appearing  
  
O come let us adore him,  
O come let us adore him,  
O come let us adore him,  
Christ the Lord,  
Christ the Lord  
O come let us adore him  
Christ the Lord


Seems like yesterday my life had begun  
As we went through life trying to make it so much fun  
And I know that I'm still in love with you  
Because you're one that have but that I can't refuse  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard  
  
Lost restrictions since you've been gone  
And it's so hard trying to say that I was wrong  
Now I know that I'm still in love with you  
Because you're one that have but that I can't refuse  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard  
  
You know and I know  
that you can't live on memories alone  
There's just one memory that I'm thinking of  
Just one habit that I can't shake off  
It's you  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard  
  
Now I know that I'm still in love with you  
Because you're one that have but that I can't refuse  
There's just one memory that I'm thinking of  
Just one habit that I can't shake off  
It's you  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard, old habits die hard


I didn't really walk away I had something to explain  
Trying to reach you night and day when I did not know your name  
Shall we promise just to talk of it alone, all alone  
  
Why can't the voice that said hello at the moment of first sight  
Whisper the words I need to know speak to me that way tonight  
Let me hear it travel through the restless sky straight from you  
Come to me today  
  
CHORUS  
One step closer forward motion  
One step nearer our destination  
One step closer forward motion  
One step nearer our destination  
  
How can I bring myself to sleep till I'm resting by your side  
Sharing the secrets hard to keep  
When you live them all through the night  
And then wake up with the words I'll always want you to say  
Come to me today  
  
CHORUS  
  
A lonely man has come undone  
Is it wrong to think I understand when you are as close to me  
And not much further to go  
  
Let me hear it travel through the restless sky straight from you  
Come to me today  
  
CHORUS  


There has to be a place for you and me  
Where we can sleep and waters still run deep  
And you're the one that sails into me  
And you're the one whose lips are silent  
You're the one that always said  
There's only one forever  
It brought us both together,  
There's only one forever  
You said to me, just give me honesty  
And in return, I'll build your santuary  
Long ago, that path was chosen  
How could we not fall in love  
Remember when we always said  
There's only one forever  
It brought us both together  
There's only one forever  
You're the one that sails into me  
You're the one whose lips are silent  
You're the one that always said  
There's only one forever  
There's only one forever  
It brought us both together  
There's only one forever  
  


Peaches and cream  
  
The light was on, and everything I felt was strong  
I watched as your mascara ran  
Didn't get far on that golden tan  
  
I heard you sigh, but I don't wanna see you cry  
You looked just like a walking dream  
Sweeter than peaches and cream  
  
[Chorus:]  
If you want me let me know  
I can show you how  
If you've got nowhere to go  
I can show you now  
  
I'm yours to tame, and I don't even know your name  
I like to touch your perfect skin  
I can't stop once I begin  
  
To show you more than I have ever shown before  
If you could read what's on my mind  
Give me yours and I'll give you mine  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
We could be, we could see  
More than we know  
We should be, we should see  
More than we know  
And I'd like to know  
  
(Chorus)(Twice)  
  
Sweeter than peaches and cream (If you want me let me know)  
Sweeter than peaches and cream (I can show you how)  
(Repeat and fade)


Painted sands and makeshift hands take us round and round  
Horizon clear, you'll soon be near and walking on the ground  
I've been round the corner sinking all the doubts in sight  
If you sail across the border, we can float into the night  
  
Oh, I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for you  
  
Cloudy Sky, the wind is high and trying to break the spell  
But I'll be here when you appear I'll see the nijtht as well  
A feeling's not a feeling if you can't believe it's true  
I'd sooner be believing 'til the ship comes sailing through'  
  
Oh, I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for you  
I'm ready for you  
  
I've been round the corner sinking all the doubts in sight  
If you sail across the border, we can float into the night  
  
Oh, I'm ready for you  
Oh, I'm ready for you  
Oh, I'm ready for you  
Oh, I'm ready for you  


Well I've got friends in the states  
And I've got friends out in space  
When information's your game  
The whole world knows your name  
And so they gave me a code  
To work this treacherous road  
For all the agents I know  
Must work incognito  
  
(chorus)  
I love my trade,  
I've got my future made.  
I put my life on the line  
To save this country of mine  
And they reward me with love  
And see I have a good time.  
So all my moves must be fast  
'cause every day is my last  
A secret agent that's slow  
Almost certain to go.  
  
(chorus)  
I've got friends in the states  
I've got friends out in space  
When information's your game  
The whole world knows your name  
And so they gave me a code  
To work this treacherous road  
For all the agents I know  
Must work incognito.  
  
(chorus)


Across the concrete sky come walk with me  
Something we need to know  
Something we need to see  
Is it love, yes its love  
Only love that is growing inside me  
If it's love, yes it's love  
Only love, is the pillar of plenty  
  
You, you make me feel, this is all I need  
And it's all so real  
You help me understand, where I want to be  
When I touch your hand  
  
I can see to the shadow of the sun  
We can be in the shadow of the sun  
  
Untie the sails, the shore will melt away  
Without a trace, I hear the raven say  
When it's love, this is love, when it's love  
That we must know we must enter  
This is love, this is love, only love  
When the dove is descended  
  
You are the winding stream going to somewhere  
That we' ve never seen  
You, are the dare to dream and the silent scream  
And the final prayer  
  
I can see to the shadow of the sun  
We can be in the shadow of the sun  
Reach out for the shadow of the sun  
Cry out for the shadow of the sun  
You are the colors of the wind  
Singing hopes, eternal spring  
In a symphony for every lonely year  
You are the keeper of the key  
And the one that longs to be  
The light for each and every frozen tear  
  


One warm night I fell in love  
The air was still, the words would flow  
We knew each other oh so well  
And though just met you'd never tell  
Sometimes we're just lonely hearts  
That ride upon a floating card  
Prepared to live those sleepless nights  
For precious time in paradise  
And now I find the future's gone  
The reasons that I had to carry on are gone  
I tried for it all  
She never heard me call at all  
There's no regrets, we made the choice  
We listened to that silent voice  
That haunts you 'til you just give in  
And makes you like a child again  
We drifted close then said goodbyes  
Just reading well each other's eyes  
The world had turned while we stood still  
And held on to each other  
And in between the right and wrong  
Is somewhere that sometimes you can belong  
I tried for it all  
She never heard me call  
And now I find the future's gone  
The reasons that I had to carry on are gone  
I cried for it all  
She never heard me call at all  


Just hear those sleigh bells jingling ring ting tingling too  
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling Yoo-hoo  
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, let's go  
Let's look at the show  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow  
  
Giddy up, giddy up, giddy up it's grand  
Just holding your hand  
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be  
  
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two  
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
  
There's a Christmas party at the home of Farmer Gray  
It would be the perfect ending of a perfect day  
  
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing  
Without a single stop  
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop  
  
There's a happy feeling nothin' in the world can buy  
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie  
  
It will nearly be like a picture print of Currier and Ives  
These wonderful things are the things we'll remember all through our lives  
These wonderful things are the things we'll remember all through our lives  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be  
  
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two  
Come on it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you


When you first found love  
Was it all that you had wanted  
For a thousand lonely years  
Was the memory so sweet  
Now your scented touch brings me  
Back to the enchanted  
All shadows fade away  
The gypsy is complete  
  
[Chorus]  
Someone is walking beside me  
Someone is waiting till I say yes I do  
Someone is living inside me  
Giving me all that I need and I need you  
Someone to cry on my shoulder  
I just want to stay here forever  
  
From the secret pool  
Did I stare at your reflection  
Let the water wash away all the battle  
From my soul  
For the bride of spring,  
Do I swear to your protection  
Today will be the day that never shall  
Grow old  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Silence broken and the blackbird is free  
Only your voice can I hear, speak to me  
  
[Chorus]


When there's a dark storm on your horizon  
And you think you can't get through it  
Just put your hand in my hand  
And I'll show you how to do it  
When the future looks uncertain  
You can count on me to be there  
And when your heart and soul are hurtin'  
Just look and you'll see me there  
Just follow where I lead  
I'll give you what you need  
A love that's always true  
And someone who believes in you  
So when you're searching for that rainbow  
I will help you find it  
And when a mountain stands before you  
I will help you climb it  
Just follow where I lead  
I'll give you what you need  
A love that's always true  
And someone who believes in you  
It's time to come alive  
Your moment has arrived  
I'll bring out the best in you  
We can have it all  
No, we will never fall  
Looking down from our celestial view  
Just follow where I lead  
I'll give you what you need  
And I'll tell you something else  
You'll start believing in yourself  
It's an easy thing to do  
When you have someone who believes in you  
Someone who believes  
Someone who believes  
I'm someone who believes  
And you've got someone who believes in you


I've been in love, I've walked alone  
I turned to you, but you were gone  
I felt the doubt, it hurt me inside  
Without your help, my hands are tied  
  
You are my home, my place to go  
My faith returned, you told me so  
I feel you now, I'm standing beside you  
Do you hear me calling  
It's to remind you, if you find me falling  
  
Hold me in your arms,  
Tell me that you want me  
Whisper all the words  
That dreams are made of  
Hold me in your arms  
Tell me are we speaking of love  
  
Don't leave me know, I've come so far  
To hear your voice, speak from your heart  
I hear you now, you're standing beside me  
Do you hear me calling  
It's to remind you, if you find me falling  
  
Hold me in your arms  
Tell me that you want me  
Whisper all the words,  
That dreams are made of  
Hold me in your arms  
Tell me are we speaking of love  
  


Love comes and goes,  
Destiny unknown  
Leads you to the promised land  
Or leaves you head in hand  
Tears fall like rain  
Coming down once again  
Stranger lost in a distant land  
Language hard to understand  
Seems like years have slipped away  
Still have so much left to say  
And I can't wait to see you  
(Chorus) When the spirit of love comes to you  
Let it into your heart  
Now's the time to turn away  
From the ghost of yesterday  
When the spirit of love comes to you  
Let it into your heart  
I'll be the one to shelter you  
The spirit of love will guide us through  
Love, right or wrong,  
Somehow we must carry on  
If only words were spoken true  
If only I could trust in you  
To believe in the dream of what could be  
Hidden clues to the mystery  
It's time to set yourself free  
(Chorus)  
Let the spirit of love come to you  
Let the spirit of love come to you  
(Chorus)


We are civilized and free from all confusion  
And yet we always worry for the things that we can't see  
But now to give your love away, a miracle in motion  
You know what seems invisible will never ever be disguised to me  
  
I start to lose control  
I start to lose control  
  
CHORUS  
I know I will remember for longer than forever  
All the love and the stars in your eyes  
Until my arms surround you and build the world around you  
All I see are the stars in your eyes  
  
First you hear the angels sing and then you see the wedding ring  
Shining as the threads of life so secretly are woven  
You know what you've found, you want to last forever  
You heart has found its wings and left for never never  
  
And then I lose control  
I start to lose control  
  
CHORUS  
  
I know I will remember for longer than forever  
All the love and the stars in your eyes  
  
CHORUS - REPEAT  
  


I stopped seeing all of our old friends  
I don't go to places that you've been  
I stopped talking about you  
Started living without you  
But there's just one thing, I don't understand  
  
How do I stop the tears  
How am I supposed to deal with this  
How do I stop the tears  
Do I get over you in a week or two  
When I been lovin' you for years  
  
Everybody thinks that I'm so strong  
They don't know what I go through when I'm alone  
I start thinkin' about you  
Goin' crazy without you  
But I stop myself and I hang up the phone  
  
How do I stop the tears  
How am I supposed to deal with this  
How do I stop the tears  
Do I get over you in a week or two  
When I been lovin' you for years  
  
One day, you'll call me up goin' crazy  
Too late you'll want me back  
You'll be sayin', you'll be saying  
  
How do I stop the tears  
How am I supposed to deal with this  
How do I stop the tears  
Do I get over you in a week or two  
When I been lovin' you for years


Strangers in love must a star fall from the sky  
It's stranger than most and stranger when we try  
To understand it all, why we fall,  
As strangers in love,  
Strangers in love.  
Straight from the farm and a world apart and ready for-  
Someone to take her arm, she's never seen a movie  
  
What an innocent face, what an innocent place.  
It's natural, it's an easy thing to do,  
Natural, it's an easy thing to do.  
Strangers in love and a star fell from the sky  
Don't know which way to turn, don't know which boat to burn  
Don't know which way to turn, don't know which boat to burn.  
Strangers in love


We walked away before  
There were too many storms  
We could not get through  
But I still kept loving you  
Now fate brought you back to me  
This time I won't let you leave  
I'm holding on to you, forever,  
I'm never letting go  
The time I spent away from you  
was time that made me see  
I need to live this life with you  
I need you here with me  
  
Now it would take a strong, strong wind  
To take me from your arms again  
To take me from your side  
It would take a strong, strong wind  
To pull away this heart of mine  
To make us break apart this time  
It would take a strong, strong wind  
  
Hearts sometimes lose their way  
But they find their way back someday  
To the arms they need  
And I need you like the air I breathe  
The time I spent away from you was time  
lost in the rain  
I'm meant to live this life with you  
That's something nothing can change  
  
And it would take a strong, strong wind  
To take me from your arms again  
To take me from your side  
It would take a strong, strong wind  
To pull away this heart of mine  
To make us break apart this time  
It would take a strong, strong wind  
  
This time I'm holding on with everything  
This time I won't let go for anything  
  
It would take a strong, strong wind  
To take me from your arms again  
To take me from your side  
It would take a strong, strong wind  
To pull away this heart of mine  
To make us break apart this time  
It would take a strong, strong wind  
Strong, strong wind


Tonight you are the world to me, part of the mystery  
And we don't need a reason to love  
Say you'll never go, that's all I need to know  
And when you close your eyes, I'll still be here  
And if the world falls  
You will be the only reason to love  
I'll find my way  
  
One heart may lie, one kiss may die  
But we live, live and learn to fly  
Beyond the darkest sky  
Stronger than the night  
  
If you hold me now, all that I feel is yours  
'cause' you're the only reason to love  
What you are to me, is all that you need to be  
And when you touch the stars, I will be there  
And when the world falls away  
I will be your only reason to love  
  
I'll find my way  
One heart may lie, one kiss may die  
But we live, live and learn to fly  
Beyond the darkest sky  
Stronger than the night  
  
One heart may lie, one kiss may die  
But we live, live and learn to fly  
Beyond the darkest sky  
Stronger than the night


Watching the sun set so low  
Tells us that it's time, the day is too end  
Nobody cries as it leaves  
Or reaches for the light  
But soon back again  
  
But then I hear you sigh  
And wish that you could stay  
I'd like another day with you  
  
Don't want to know where it ends  
I'll live with either way  
Just tell me what I have to do.  
  
Where is the joy time forgets  
You ask me if I know  
It's still as before  
Up on a breeze soaring high  
It comes alive each day  
Whenever you call  
But now to lose your love  
The charm throughout my day  
To walk along our paths all alone  
  
I have memories enough  
To help me find my way  
To bring back all the love we've known


These days it's hard to make love last, so hard to do, it  
Seems these days it comes and goes so fast,  
So easy to lose it  
  
Promise me now, promise with you I'll find,  
One love to stand the test of time...  
  
Swear, swear to your heart (swear)  
That you're never never gonna leave me  
Swear, swear to your heart  
That you're never gonna go  
I, I wanna hear  
That you're always always gonna love me  
Swear, swear to your heart  
  
We've got to make a solemn vow, keep it forever,  
Know whatever happens that somehow, we'll keep it together  
  
I'll pledge my heart, I'll pledge my soul to you  
Just take my hand, and say that you...  
  
Swear, swear to your heart (swear)  
That you're never never gonna leave me  
Swear, swear to your heart  
That you're never gonna go  
I, I wanna hear  
That you're always always gonna love me  
Swear, swear to your heart  
  
That you're gonna stand beside me  
Always be there,  
If you really care,  
Just stand here beside me and swear  
  
(Swear)  
(Swear)  
  
I'll pledge my heart, I'll pledge my soul to you  
Just take my hand, and say that you...  
  
Swear, swear to your heart (swear)  
That you're never never gonna leave me  
Swear, swear to your heart  
That you're never gonna go  
I, I wanna hear  
That you're always always gonna love me  
Swear, swear to your heart


This is the time when you need a friend  
You just need someone near  
I'm not looking forward to the night  
I'll spend thinking of you when you're not here  
  
How many times will I think about the things  
I'd like to do  
Always denied the right to live my life the way I want  
I want to share it with you  
  
Close your eyes  
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams  
Close your eyes  
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams  
  
I'll think of your kiss as the days roll by  
And I'll write the words you love  
What I can't say in a letter  
Will just have to wait till I get home  
  
There's not much time to tell you  
Half the things I should  
Only that I'm so glad I fell in love with you  
And I'd do it again if I could  
  
Close your eyes  
I want to ride the skies in my sweet dreams  
Close your eyes  
I want to see you tonight in my sweet dreams  
  
Sleep like a child resting deep  
You don't know what you give me I keep  
For these moments alone


You're in-between a page of life you never dreamed  
The answer won't come from that magazine  
this time it's real and you're not sure just what to feel  
Who can I trust to say  
Should I give love now should I take love now  
  
CHORUS  
I'm taking the chance  
And giving myself to you  
If something's not right then tell me I'm wrong  
I just want it all to carry on  
  
Sometimes the fear of losing you has been so near  
I needed to make this choice on my own  
To let love in when I'm so scared when things begin  
Don't run away I feel close to you now  
You know I need you now  
  
CHORUS  
I'm taking the chance  
And giving myself to you  
If something's not right then tell me I'm wrong  
I just want it all to carry on  
I'm taking the chance  
I can't let this feeling leave  
I don't want those nights of waiting so long  
I'm taking the chance before it's gone  
  
Taking the chance  
Taking the chance  
Taking the chance  
Taking the chance  
On you  
  
CHORUS  
  


The first noel  
The angels did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds  
In fields where they lay  
In fields where they  
Lay keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night  
That was so deep  
  
Noel, noel, noel, noel  
Born is the king of israel  
  
They looked up  
And saw a star  
Shining in the east  
Beyond them far  
And to the earth  
It gave great light  
And so it continued both day and night  
  
Noel, noel, noel, noel  
Born is the king of Israel  
  
And let us all  
With one accord  
Sing praises to our heavenly lord  
That hath in heaven and earth of naught  
And with his blood mankind hath bought  
  
Noel, noel, noel, noel  
Born is the king of Israel  
  
Born is the king  
Born is the king  
Born is the king


Now you tell me that the time is right  
You've let your feeling go  
And you know I won't use them up too fast  
I can't promise you the best there is  
But ooh, I'm gonna try  
I'm never gonna let you go tonite  
  
Tonite, the start of a love to remember  
Tonite, a love that will never be ended  
Tonite, tonite  
  
Let me take you where there's no return  
Where dreams can all come true  
I've got the feeling we've been holding on too long  
What we're feeling is ours alone  
No one will ever know  
Just how we feel about tonite  
  
Tonite, the start of a love to remember  
Tonite, a love that will never be ended  
Tonite, tonite  
  
How many times has love fallen through  
When I left it all up to you  
I took your words when you said  
It's got to be just right  
I need you now I need you now  
  
Tonite, the start of a love to remember  
Tonite, a love that will never be ended  
Tonite, tonite  
  


One world, one love, these can never be apart  
Whisper in your words what is in your heart  
How can I stop this emotion knowing that it's true  
Am I too sentimental for you  
Have I gone too far  
If I knew this feeling is part of you too, girl  
  
Midnight, candlelight  
Knowing you are close to me  
So much I have inside  
I've got to set it free  
  
With you silence can be spoken  
If love has broken through  
Am I too sentimental for you  
Have I gone too far  
If I knew that this feeling is part of you too, girl  
  
Ooh, sentimental man  
Am I saying too much too soon  
Cause I love you  
Such a gentle girl  
Waiting for you  
  
One love, two touch, we can never be apart  
I want you so much for what is in your heart  
How can we stop this emotion knowing that it's true  
Am I too sentimental for you  
Have I gone too far  
If I knew that this feeling is part of you too, girl  
  


Turnaround, every now and then I get a  
Little bit lonely and you're never coming around  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and  
Then I fall apart  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and  
Then I fall apart  
  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit restless and I dream of something wild  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit helpless and I'm lying like a child in your arms  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit angry and I know I've got to get out and cry  
Turnaround, Every now and then I get a  
Little bit terrified but then I see the look in your eyes  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and  
Then I fall apart  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and  
Then I fall apart  
  
And I need you now tonight  
And I need you more than ever  
And if you'll only hold me tight  
We'll be holding on forever  
And we'll only be making it right  
Cause we'll never be wrong together  
We can take it to the end of the line  
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time  
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark  
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks  
I really need you tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
Forever's gonna start tonight  
  
Once upon a time I was falling in love  
But now I'm only falling apart  
There's nothing I can do  
A total eclipse of the heart  
Once upon a time there was light in my life  
But now there's only love in the dark  
Nothing I can say  
A total eclipse of the heart  
  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and  
Then I fall apart  
Turnaround bright eyes, Every now and  
Then I fall apart

And I need you more than ever  
And if you'll only hold me tight  
We'll be holding on forever  
And we'll only be making it right

All the people in the world  
Distant voices to be heard  
Sacred rhythm shall make you free  
Dance together, unity  
From creation, the mask of God  
Inspiration is all we've got  
Hidden knowledge, can't get enough,  
Taking chances, making love  
  
Face to face with the moment of truth,  
All those little white lies  
We the people, we the people decide  
  
We the people, shedding skin  
Age of reason lies within  
Explanation, the club of Rome  
Meditation, and staying home  
Moving forward, the chosen few  
Teach your children what is new  
Band the table, beat the drum  
New messiah, overcome  
  
Face to face with the moment of truth,  
All those little white lies  
We the people, we the people decide  
We the people, we the people decide  
  
All the people in the world  
Distant voices to be heard  
Sacred rhythm shall make you free  
Dance together, unity  
  
Face to face with the moment of truth,  
All those little white lies  
We the people, we the people decide  
We the people, we the people decide  
  
Face to face with the moment of truth,  
All those little white lies  
We the people, we the people decide  
We the people, we the people decide  
  
We the people, we the people decide  
We the people, we the people decide  
  


Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'  
In the lane, snow is glistenin'  
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away is the bluebird  
Here to stay is a new bird  
He sings a love song, as we go along  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
Then pretend that he is parson brown  
He'll say are you married, we'll say no man  
But you can do the job when you're in town  
  
Later on we'll conspire, as we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid, the plans that we made  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with mr. snowman  
Until the other kids knock him down  
  
When it snows, ain't it thrillin'  
Though your nose gets chillin'  
We'll frolic and play the eskimo way  
  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
Walking in a winter wonderland


Before you go away  
To the one you do belong  
So glad we met and you stayed  
Though it wasn't very long  
Was it only just a dream  
It's over now it seems  
If there were no goodbyes  
Would you stay that you still care  
I won't believe my eyes  
When I see you won't be there  
'Cause this love so hard to find  
Now you're leavin' me behind  
Oh please  
  
CHORUS:  
Show me and tell me  
How do you put this love aside  
(And) Put it away for another time  
With no guarantee that you'll be mine  
A fool I am it seems  
'Cause I'll been lovin' you in my dreams  
Until I wake up and I find out  
That time ain't our friend  
I'll just stay a fool till the end  
  
(Till the end, I'll be a fool)  
(Till I find it's me and you)  
If it only was game  
Why'd you have to fool my heart  
Oh girl ain't it a shame  
That we promised from the start  
That our love was here to stay  
For each and everyday  
If I had only known  
And if I didn't have to care  
Then being all alone  
It wouln't be so hard to bear  
This love so hard to find  
That we're leavin' here behind  
Oh please  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
I maybe over acting  
I know I must stay strong  
But you pulled the string too hard  
And now we're going on our own  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
Till the end  
You know I just stay a fool


I've known you for so long  
You are a friend of mine  
But is this all we'd ever be?  
I've loved you ever since  
You are a friend of mine  
But babe, is this all we ever could be?  
  
You tell me things I've never known  
I've shown you love you've never shown  
But then again, when you cry  
I'm always at your side  
You tell me 'bout the love you've had  
I listen very eagerly  
But deep inside you'll never see  
This feeling of emptiness  
It makes me feel sad  
But then again I'm glad  
  
I've known you all my life  
You are a friend of mine  
I know this is how it's gonna be  
I've loved you then and I love you still  
You're a friend of mine  
Now, I know friends are all we ever could be  
  
You tell me things I've never known  
I've shown you love you've never shown  
But then again, when you cry  
I'm always at your side  
You tell me 'bout the love you've had  
And I listen very eagerly  
But deep inside you'll never see  
This feeling of emptiness  
It makes me feel sad  
  
But then again  
Then again  
Then again I'm glad


Kay bilis naman ng panahon  
Kailan lang tayo nagkatagpo  
Pareho ng hangarin iibig sa atin  
Ay matagpuan at di pakakawalan  
  
Di natin pinilit ang pagkakataon  
Pagkakaibiga'y nauwi sa pagmamahalan  
Ngunit ika'y nagbago natakot ang 'yong puso  
Na mahulog at umibig muli  
  
Wag mong iwan ang puso kong mag-isa  
Pagkat mabuhay ng wala ka'y di makakaya  
Sa sandaling ikaw ay lumisan  
Wala ng pag-asa sa aki'y maiiwan  
  
Wag mong sayangin ang pagmamahal  
Na ating pinangarap nang kay tagal  
Minsan lang sa buhay natin ang ganito  
Mahal ko, wag mong iwan ang puso ko  
  
Wag mong iwan ang puso kong mag-isa  
Pagkat mabuhay ng wala ka'y di makakaya  
Sa sandaling ikaw ay lumisan  
  
Wala ng pag-asa sa aki'y maiiwan


I'm so blessed my Lord  
I can see you  
In all the lovely things  
So fine and true  
I see you in the beauty  
Of the flowers and the rain  
I see you between the lines  
Of a sweet refrain  
I'm so blessed my Lord  
I can see you  
Even when I'm lonely and in pain  
I see you in the beauty of the stars at night  
I see you in my life  
I feel alright  
I see you Lord  
In sorrow and in happiness  
I see you in the glory  
Of sweet success  
I see you Lord  
Every hour, everyday  
I can see you Lord  
Whenever I pray  
I'm so blessed my Lord  
I can see you  
In the smile of a baby  
Sweet and true  
I can see you in the eyes  
Of my very best friends  
I see you in these bonds  
Just like your love that never ends  
I see you Lord  
In sorrow and in happiness  
I see you in the glory  
Of sweet success  
I see you Lord  
Every hour, everyday  
I can see you Lord  
Whenever I pray  
I see you Lord  
In sorrow and in happiness  
I see you in the glory  
Of sweet success  
I see you Lord  
Every hour, everyday  
I can see you Lord  
Whenever I pray  
I pray...  
I can see you Lord  
Whenever I pray...  
I see you Lord...


If a picture paints a thousand words  
Then why can't I paint you  
The words will never show  
The you I've come to know  
  
If a face could launch a thousand ships  
Then where am I to go  
There's no one home but you  
You're all that's left me too  
  
And when my love  
For life is running dry  
You'll come and pour yourself on me  
  
If a man could be two places  
At one time I'd be with you  
Tomorrow and today  
Beside you all the way  
  
If the world should start revolving  
Spinning slowly down to die  
I'd spend the end with you  
And when the world was through  
  
Then one by one  
The stars would all go out  
Then you and I would simply fly away


When I see you on the street  
I lose my concentration  
Just the thought that we might meet  
Creates anticipation  
  
Won't you look my way once before you go  
And my eyes will say what you ought to know  
Well, I've been thinkin' about you day and night  
And I don't know if it'll work out right  
But somehow I think that it just might  
If we try  
  
Faces come and faces go  
In circular rotation  
But something yearns within to grow  
Beyond infatuation  
  
Won't you look my way once before you go  
And my eyes will say what you ought to know  
Well you've got me standin' deaf and blind  
'Cause I see love as just a state of mind  
And who knows what it is that we might find  
If we try  
And who knows what it is that we might find  
If we try  
  
You've walkin' a diff'rent direction  
From most people I've met  
You've givin' me signs of affection  
I don't usually get  
I don't want you to pledge your future  
The future's not yours to give  
Just stand there a little longer  
And let me watch you while you leave  
  
'Cause when I see you on the street  
I lose my concentration  
And just the thought that we might meet  
Creates anticipation  
  
Won't you look my way once before you go  
And my eyes will say what you ought to know  
Well, I've been thinkin' about you day and night  
And I don't know if it'll work out right  
But somehow I think that it just might  
If we try  
  
Somehow I think that it just might  
If we try  
Yes, somehow I think that it just might  
If we try


Itanong mo sa akin  
Kung sino'ng aking mahal  
Itanong mo sa akin  
Sagot ko'y di magtatagal

Ang laging isisigaw  
Ikaw ang aking mahal...  
Ikaw ang aking mahal...  
Ikaw ang aking mahal...


Ang ganda ng buhay, mahal kong Diyos

Nais kong mabuhay sa mundong kay ganda  
Na dinadakila'y pangalan Mo tuwina  
  
[Chorus]  
Ikaw na ang bahala sa amin Ama  
At sa mga araw na darating pa  
Dalangin namin ay pagpalain Mo sana  
Ikaw ang pag-ibig namin at pag-asa  
  
Ikaw na ang bahala sa amin Ama  
At sa mga araw na darating pa  
Tanging sa 'Yo lamang hihingi ng awa  
Sa bawat sandali Ikaw na ang bahala  
  
Makulay ang buhay, mahal kong Diyos  
Sana pagmamahal Mo sa mundo'y mabuhos  
Salamat sa pag-ibig na nasa puso ko  
Salamat sa buhay na galing sa Iyo  
  
[Chorus]  
Ikaw na ang bahala sa amin Ama  
At sa mga araw na darating pa  
Dalangin namin ay pagpalain Mo sana  
Ikaw ang pag-ibig namin at pag-asa  
  
Ikaw na ang bahala sa amin Ama  
At sa mga araw na darating pa  
Tanging sa 'Yo lamang hihingi ng awa  
Sa bawat sandali Ikaw na ang bahala(2x)  
  
Sa bawat sandali Ikaw na ang bahala


Strolling along country roads with my baby  
It starts to rain, it begins to pour  
Without an umbrella we're soaked to the skin  
I feel a shiver run up my spine  
I feel the warmth of his hand in mine  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo, how I love the rainy days  
And the happy ways I feel inside  
  
After a while we run under a tree  
I turn to him and he kisses me  
There with the beat of the rain on the leaves  
Softly he breathes and I close my eyes  
Sharing our love under stormy skies  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo, how I love the rainy days  
And the happy ways I feel inside  
  
[Break]  
  
I feel the warmth of his hand in mine  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo, how I love the rainy days  
And the happy ways I feel inside  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo, how I love the rainy days  
And the happy ways I feel inside  
  
Oo, I hear laughter in the rain  
Walking hand in hand with the one I love  
Oo, how I love the rainy days  
And the happy ways I feel inside


Intro:  
  
Lying beside you, here in the dark  
Feeling your heart beat with mind  
Softly you whisper, you're so sincere  
How could our live be so blind  
We sailed on together  
We drifted apart  
And here you are by my side  
  
Chorus:  
  
So now I come to you, with open arms  
Nothing to hide, believe what I say  
So here I am with open arms  
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me  
Open arms  
  
Ii.  
  
Living without you, living alone  
This empty house seems so cold  
Wanting to hold you, wanting you near  
How much I wanted you home  
  
But now that you've come back  
Turned night into day  
I need you to stay.  
  
(Repeat Chorus)


[Verse 1]  
Nais kong malaman niya  
Nag mamahal ako  
'Yan lang ang nag-iisang pangarap ko  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Gusto ko mang sabihin  
Di ko kayang simulan  
Pag nagkita kayo  
Paki sabi na lang  
[Chorus]  
Paki sabi na lang na mahal ko siya  
Di na baleng may mahal siyang iba  
Paki sabing 'wag siyang mag-alala  
Di ako umaasa

Di ko na mababago  
Ganun pa man paki sabi na lang  
Sana ay malaman niya

Paki sabi na lang

Magmula giliw nang ika'y pumanaw  
Katawan at puso ko'y walang paglagyan  
Lakad ng dugo sa mukha ay madalang  
Lalo't magunita ang itong palayaw  
  
Saan pa tutungo yaring kalagayan  
Dalamhating lubos, liit ng katawan  
Masaya't kumain, hindi mapalagay  
Maupo't tumindig, alaala'y ikaw  
  
Paalam sa 'yo masarap magmahal  
May ari ng puso ko't kabiyak na katawan  
Paalam na nga, yaring pinalalayaw  
Paalam, giliw ko sayo'y paalam  
  
At kung gumabi na, banig ay ihihiga  
Matang nag-aantok, ipipikit na bigla  
Sa pagkahimbing, panaginip ka sinta  
Sabay ang balon na di mapigil na luha  
  
Lilimutin mo yaring kahabag habag  
Puhunang buhay tatawirin ang dagat  
Pag alis ay sakit, paroroonan ay hirap  
Masayang palad mo sa huli ang sikat  
  
Paalam sa 'yo masarap magmahal  
May ari ng puso ko't kabiyak na katawan  
Paalam na nga, yaring pinalalayaw  
Paalam, giliw ko  
  
Sama ng loob ko'y sa akin mag isa  
Di maipahayag sa mga kasama  
Puso ko ay lubos na pinagdurusa  
Tamis na bilin mo'y, magtiis ka sinta  
  
Paalam sa 'yo masarap magmahal  
May ari ng puso ko't kabiyak na katawan  
Paalam na nga, yaring pinalalayaw  
Paalam, giliw ko sayo'y paalam  
  
Paalam  
Masayang palad mo sa huli ang sikat.


Sana'y di magmaliw ang dati kong araw  
Nang munti pang bata sa piling ni nanay  
Nais kong maulit ang awit ni inang mahal  
Awit ng pag-ibig habang ako'y nasa duyan  
  
Sana'y di magmaliw ang dati kong araw  
Nang munti pang bata sa piling ni nanay  
Nais kong maulit ang awit ni inang mahal  
Awit ng pag-ibig habang ako'y nasa duyan  
  
Sa aking pagtulog na labis ang himbing  
Ang bantay ko'y tala, ang tanod ko'y bituin  
Sa piling ni nanay, langit ay buhay  
Puso kong may dusa sabik sa ugoy ng duyan  
  
Sana'y di magmaliw ang dati kong araw  
Nang munti pang bata sa piling ni nanay  
Nais kong maulit ang awit ni inang mahal  
Awit ng pag-ibig habang ako'y nasa duyan  
  
Sa aking pagtulog na labis ang himbing  
Ang bantay ko'y tala, ang tanod ko'y bituin  
Sa piling ni nanay, langit ay buhay  
Puso kong may dusa sabik sa ugoy ng duyan  
  
Sana'y di magmaliw ang dati kong araw  
Nang munti pang bata sa piling ni nanay  
Nais kong maulit ang awit ni inang mahal  
Awit ng pag-ibig habang ako'y nasa duyan  
  
Nais kong matulog sa dating duyan ko inay  
Oh,Inay


How thoughtless  
I had sometimes been  
I hurt you so badly  
But now I feel the pain  
I talked to you as if  
I knew just everything  
Maybe I didn't lose  
But I know I didn't win  
How careless  
I had sometimes been  
I gave you the heartache  
But I felt the pain  
I wanted to tell you  
How much I love you so  
I know I'd been careless  
I forgot to let you know  
Sorry, I'm so sorry  
I didn't mean to hurt you  
You know I got hurt too  
Sorry, I'm so sorry  
I didn't mean to break your heart  
Please let me make a brand new start  
How crazy  
I had sometimes been  
I hurt you so badly  
But now I feel the pain  
Next time I'll know better  
I'll have more time for you  
I'll listen to your heart  
Just like you asked me to  
Sorry, I'm so sorry  
I didn't mean to hurt you  
You know I got hurt too  
Sorry, I'm so sorry  
Forgive my many faults  
And the foolish things I've done  
I was so insensitive  
And I didn't understand  
Sorry, I'm so sorry  
I didn't mean to hurt you  
You know I got hurt too  
Sorry, I'm so sorry  
I didn't mean to break your heart  
Please let me make a brand new start


Calling, calling all angels, oh I'm calling, calling all angels  
  
The night was still, the moon was bright when he saw a distant light  
So he started walkin' till he found a church outside of town  
And he stumbled in and closed the door, said why I'm here, I'm not sure  
It's my baby that I'm lookin' for, can't she see I'm down on my knees  
  
I've been calling, calling all angels, bring my baby back  
Oh you must know where she's at, tell me what to do, I know she's one of you  
I'm down on my knees, tell her please, that I love her so  
  
Tell me preacher, man to man, will you do all that you can  
I've done wrong, this I know, and I really hurt her so  
It's a lonely world I'm livin' in, an ocean of tears I been cryin'  
In this greatest hour of need, what can be done for a fool like me  
  
Oh, I'm calling, calling all angels, bring my baby back  
Oh you must know where she's at, yes I've been a fool  
And I know that she's one of you, now do this for me, tell her please  
  
And if she's lonely I'll make her understand  
That these arms can carry both of us back to heaven again  
  
Yes I've been a fool and I know that she's one of you  
Do this for me, tell her please  
  
Calling, calling all angels  
Hear me calling, calling all angels  
Oh I'm calling, calling all angels  
Hear me calling, calling all angels  
Oh I'm calling, calling all angels  
Hear me calling, calling all angels  
Oh I'm calling, calling all angels


I thought it was forever  
I thought it would last  
Gotta try to make it  
A page of my past  
You didn't even say goodbye  
When you slammed that door  
  
Now I'm lyin' here alone  
In what once was our bed  
Trying to forget  
All the cruel words you said  
All the radio was playing  
What once was our favorite song  
  
Oh enough is enough I won't take anymore  
I'm picking myself up off the floor  
  
'Cause you can't keep a good man down  
You can't keep a good man down  
Oh no you can't keep a good man down  
Sugar, you can't keep a good man down  
  
Gonna dress up in my finest  
Clothes that I own  
And take it to the streets  
I won't be lonely for long  
Gonna put on my best moves  
On every single woman I see  
  
Now you thought you could break me  
Add me to your list  
Notch me on your gun  
Let me tell you this  
I've got news for you baby  
I don't break that easily  
  
'Cause you can't keep a good man down  
You can't keep a good man down  
Oh no you can't keep a good man down  
Sugar, you can't keep a good man down  
  
I'll be out there on the scene  
Hangin' with my friends  
This world's gonna see  
Me smilin' again  
I'm taking some time  
To erase you from my memory  
  
Don't write any letters  
Don't call me on the phone  
Don't knock on my door  
Cause to you I'm not at home  
I know there's a woman out there  
For a man like me  
  
'Cause you can't keep a good man down  
You can't keep a good man down  
Oh no you can't keep a good man down  
Sugar, you can't keep a good man down  
  
Oh enough is enough I won't take anymore  
I'm picking myself up off the floor  
  
'Cause you can't keep a good man down  
Baby, you can't keep a good man down  
Honey, you can't keep a good man down  
Sugar, you can't keep a good man down


Somewhere in the mountains......... In northern Alabama  
The Carolina lady waits for her man from Tennessee  
Somewhere in a motel...... Out in Oklahoma  
There's the Alabama dreamer  
That same man from Tennessee  
  
Sometime late at night...... The lonely wakes her gently  
And knocks at her door...... But she won't give in  
But like every other woman........ She needs to feel wanted  
She thinks of making love....... And goes to sleep again  
  
Carolina......... Dreamin' lonely  
Carolina......... Can't you see  
You will always be the lady.....  
That I dream of holding tight.....  
That I kiss and tell goodnight.....  
Carolina....... Mountain dewe  
  
Sometime that next day..... On a Mississippi freeway  
The Alabama dreamer........ Is homeward bound  
His conscious is as clear........ As those green eyes of Carolina  
And she's waiting with the baby from the love.............. Of the only man to  
Lay her down  
  
Carolina.......... Dreaming lonely  
Carolina.......... Can't you see  
You will always be the lady  
That I dream of holding tight  
That I kiss and tell goodnight  
Carolina...... Mountain dewe  
Carolina.......... I love you


By now in New York City, there's snow on the ground  
And out in California, the sunshine's falling down  
And, maybe down in Memphis, Graceland's all in lights  
And in Atlanta, Georgia, there's peace on earth tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Christmas in Dixie, it's snowin' in the pines  
Merry Christmas from Dixie, to everyone tonight  
  
It's windy in Chicago. The kids are out of school  
There's magic in Motown. The city's on the move  
In Jackson, Mississippi, to Charlotte, Caroline  
And all across the nation, it's the peaceful Christmas time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And from Fort Payne, Alabama  
God bless why'all...We love ya...Happy New Year...Good night  
Merry Christmas...Merry Christmas tonight


All my friends are asking me where I plan to spend the holidays  
People seem to celebrate the season in so many different ways  
Some go where the weather's freezing cold while others like it warm  
I don't care about the weather just whether I spend Christmas in your arms  
  
[Chorus:]  
We could drive up to the mountains, build a fire and watch it snow  
We could sail down to the islands where the gentle breezes blow  
I'd be happy in the city, I'd be happy on the farm  
I don't care where I spend Christmas as long as I spend Christmas in your arms  
  
It was only last December I had no Christmas spirit in my heart  
My world lay cold and shattered in the ashes of a dream that fell apart  
But now you're here beside me, no greater gift is wrapped beneath my tree  
And the arms you wrap around me and the precious gift of love you give to me  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't care where I spend Christmas as long as I spend Christmas in your arms


It's that time of year when the whole world is heart tot heart  
You can feel love all around you, you can see it everywhere  
  
Christmas is love, it's in the songs we're singing  
Christmas is love, it's families comin' home  
Christmas is love, it's on the children's faces  
Christmas is love  
  
Christmas is love, a warm and friendly feeling  
Christmas is love, hear the church bells ring  
Christmas is love, it's sharing in the giving  
Christmas is love  
  
We all gather 'round, watch the lights dancing on the tree  
The spirit of the season, you feel it in the air  
  
Christmas is love, it's in the songs we're singing  
Christmas is love, it's families comin' home  
Christmas is love, it's on the children's faces  
  
Christmas is love, a warm and friendly feeling  
Christmas is love, just hear the church bells ring  
Christmas is love, it's sharing in the giving  
Christmas is love, Christmas is love, Christmas is love


It was almost Christmas time  
There I stood in another line  
Tryin to buy that last gift or two  
Not really in the Christmas mood  
  
Standin right in front of me  
Was a little boy waiting anxiously  
Pacing round like little boys do  
And in his hands he held a pair of shoes  
  
And his clothes were worn and old  
He was dirty from head to toe  
And when it came his time to pay  
I couldn't believe what I heard him say  
  
Sir, I wanna buy these shoes  
For my mama, please  
Its Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size  
Could you hurry, sir?  
Daddy says theres not much time  
You see, shes been sick for quite a while  
And I, know these shoes will make her smile  
And I, want her to look beautiful  
If mama meets Jesus tonight  
  
He counted pennies for what seemed like years  
And the, cashier said Son, theres not enough here.  
He searched his pockets franticly  
Then he turned and he looked at me  
He said Mama made Christmas good at our house  
Most years she just did without  
Tell me, sir, what am I gonna do  
Somehow I've gotta buy her these Christmas shoes  
  
So I laid the money down  
I just had to help him out  
And Ill never forget the look on his face  
When he said Mamas gonna look so great  
  
Sir, I wanna buy these shoes  
For my mama, please  
Its Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size  
Could you hurry, sir?  
Daddy says theres not much time  
You see, shes been sick for quite a while  
And I, know these shoes will make her smile  
And I, want her to look beautiful  
If mama meets Jesus tonight  
  
I knew I caught a glimpse of heaven love  
As he thanked me and ran out  
I knew that god had sent that little boy to remind me  
What Christmas is all about  
  
Sir, I wanna buy these shoes  
For my mama, please  
Its Christmas eve and these shoes are just her size  
Could you hurry, sir?  
Daddy says theres not much time  
You see, shes been sick for quite a while  
And I, know these shoes will make her smile  
And I, want her to look beautiful  
If mama meets Jesus tonight  
  
I want her to look beautiful  
If mama meets Jesus tonight


  
Come to the church by the wildwood  
Oh, come to the church in the vale  
No spot is so dear to my childhood  
As the little brown church in the vale  
  
How sweet on a clear Sabbath morning  
To listen to the clear ringing bells  
It's tones so sweetly are calling  
Oh, come to the church in the vale  
  
Come to the church by the wildwood  
Oh, come to the church in the vale  
No spot is so dear to my childhood  
As the little brown church in the vale  
  
There she sleeps close by the church in the valley  
Lies one that I love so well  
She sleeps, sweetly sleeps, neath the willow  
Disturb not her rest in the vale  
  
Come to the church by the wildwood  
Oh, come to the church in the vale  
No spot is so dear to my childhood  
As the little brown church in the vale  
  
There close by the site of that loved one  
Neath the tree where the wild flowers bloom  
When farewell hymns shall be chanted  
I shall rest by her side in the tomb  
  
Come to the church by the wildwood  
Oh, come to the church in the vale  
No spot is so dear to my childhood  
As the little brown church in the vale  
As the little brown church in the vale  
  


Just outside of Austin  
I turned on my radio  
Turned it in to a satellite station  
She was talkin' on a call-in show  
She said it was over, she'd made her choice  
Her mind was made-up by the sound of her voice  
  
Clear across America tonight  
Clear coast-to-coast tonight  
She's long gone, she's outta here  
But she's comin' through loud and clear  
Clear across America tonight  
  
Sounded like he really had it coming  
All the times he'd done her wrong  
She said, I hope he's listening  
And hung-up the telephone  
All of a sudden, I realized  
It was me she was telling good-bye  
  
Clear across America tonight  
Clear coast-to-coast tonight  
She's long gone, she's outta here  
But she's comin' through loud and clear  
Clear across America tonight  
  
Hello DJ, put me on the air  
Give me the chance to tell her I still care  
Get her back on the line, tell her I'm still in love  
Said, "sorry son, but you're breaking up"  
  
Clear across America tonight  
Clear coast-to-coast tonight  
She's long gone, she's outta here  
But she's comin' through loud and clear  
Across America tonight  
  
Across America tonight  
Clear across America tonight  
Clear across America tonight  
Clear across America tonight


Clear water blues, thinkin' of you  
Sittin' here fishin', catchin' a few  
Spendin' my days just tryin' to lose  
These clear water blues  
  
Clear water blues driftin' along  
Nowhere to go, now that you're gone  
My lonely heart don't know what to do  
With these clear water blues  
  
Lookin' out across the ocean  
Blue is all I see  
And it seems like no matter how far I go  
Your memory just won't set me free  
  
Clear water blues won't leave me alone  
Keeps on remindin' me why you're gone  
My reflection is showin' a fool  
In these clear water blues  
  
Clear water blues, still thinkin' of you  
Sittin' here fishin', catchin' a few  
Spendin' my days just tryin' to lose  
These clear water blues  
These clear water blues


Sometimes her morning coffee's way too strong  
And sometimes what she says she says all wrong  
But right or wrong she's there beside me  
Like only a friend would be  
And that's close enough to perfect for me  
  
Now she's been known to wear her pants too tight  
And drinking puts her out just like a light  
Heaven know's she's not an angel, but she'd really like to be  
And that's close enough to perfect for me  
  
She kisses me each morning  
And smiles her sleepy smile  
And she don't have to say it  
I can see it in her eyes  
Don't you worry about my woman  
Or what you think she ought to be  
'Cause she's close enough to perfect for me  
  
Well sometimes she gets down and starts to cry  
But then again a lady has a right  
She's everything I ever wanted, she's all I'll ever need  
She's close enough to perfect for me  
  
She kisses me each morning  
And smiles her sleepy smile  
And she don't have to say it  
I can see it in her eyes  
Don't you worry about my woman  
Or what you think she ought to be  
'Cause she's close enough to perfect for me  
  
Oh, she's close enough to perfect for me


You can have your buildings and your arithmetic  
I don't need no crowded streets or city slicker tricks  
I just need to be some place where I can move around  
Look down at my toes and I can still see the ground  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I can stretch out right  
Give me the country side  
(Give me the country side)  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I don't get uptight  
Give me the country side  
Goin' down to the fishing pond where I can throw the line  
It don't' matter what fish I catch I only came to rest my mind  
The only fish you'll get down town ain't caught with a hook and sinker  
Put on your brakes, beep beep, honk your horn look out now turn on your
blinker  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I can stretch out right  
Give me the country side  
(Give me the country side)  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I don't get uptight  
Give me the country side  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I don't get uptight  
Give me the country side  
I was born in Georgia town with a lack-a-daisy street  
A laid back lover just a-playin' games and a-stayin' off of them feet  
Nobody trying to get on your nerves, nobody tryin' to get what you've got  
And just live and let live by the golden rule now don't it just hit the spot  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I can stretch out right  
Give me the country side  
(Give me the country side)  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I don't get uptight  
Give me the country side  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I can stretch out right  
Give me the country side  
Give me that country side of life  
Where I don't get uptight  
Give me the country side


Written by randy owen, teddy gentry, and greg fowler  
Well the magic attic's where the music rolls  
And the army-navy's got ol' jackie soul  
Down on peaches corner there are good ol' boys  
And mother fletchers makin' lots of noise  
They're dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
Dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
  
Well the tams are playin' at the port-o-call  
And the drifters underneath the boardwalk  
At the sapnish galleon and ol' fat jacks  
Jukebox playin' and the place is packed  
You bet they're dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
You know they're dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
  
Got the top down and the traffic's slow  
Sun fun week and, we all go  
Where the girls are sunnin' and lookin' good  
Well i never met 'em but i wish i could  
And we'd go dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
We'd go dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
  
Well the embers singin' up on ocean drive  
And the castaways are gettin' loud tonight  
At the electric circus they all getin' down  
And the carousel's spinnin' round and 'round  
See them dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
I see 'em dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
  
Well i'm hangin out down at sloppy joes  
They may doze but they never close  
And the bama boys at the bowery  
They can't dance but they play for free  
But they like dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
They know dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
They wrote dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
  
Dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
Dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
Shaggin' on the boulevard  
Dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard  
Dancin', shaggin' on the boulevard


I was raised in the shadows of an old cotton mill  
Back when believin' was the style  
Small town heaven and a big-eyed boy  
Made sweet music for a while  
My daddy worked hard down at the factory  
Nights he went to G.I. school  
He didn't know nothin' 'bout the silver spoon  
But he lived by the golden rule  
  
Summer nights he was gone me and mama stayed home  
Out on the front porch swing  
Wishin' on the stars in the southern sky  
And sometimes we used to sing  
  
We were leaning, leaning on  
The everlasting arms of love  
Livin' all those simple joys  
This Dixie boy is made of  
  
Got my real education from the T.V. station  
And good ole boys down at the park  
The say "Hey, Willie" and those rock-a-billies  
Made their way into my heart  
  
I remember the old folks sittin' 'round talkin'  
On laidback Sunday afternoons  
They said them young folks sure got a hard road  
Oh, they're growin' up too soon  
  
Now I know they were right, and as I sit here tonight  
Out on the front porch swing  
The stars are shinin' in my young boy's eyes  
Just like they did for me  
  
We are leaning, leaning on  
The everlasting arms of love  
Livin' all those simple joys  
This Dixie boy is made of  
  
We are leaning, leaning on  
The everlasting arms of love  
Livin' all those simple joys  
This Dixie boy is made of


I'm not a stranger to passion,  
I've seen a lot of love in my time  
Felt that physical attraction,  
From the touch in the heat of the night  
Been all over the country,  
Started my share of new flames  
But after all is said and done,  
there's only one that remains  
  
[Chorus]  
Dixie fire burning down in my soul  
Dixie fire it never leaves me whole  
It took a hometown girl to show me  
How cruel these hot summer nights can be  
Now there's a Dixie fire burning in the heart of me  
Burning in the heart of me  
  
Searching for some kind of direction,  
Looking for a guiding light  
Needed to see a lighthouse,  
Like a ship on a stormy night  
Somehow you heard my music,  
You felt the sadness in me  
You took the words that were so cold,  
And added a warm melody  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Burn, burn, burning  
Burn, burn, burning (Cant you see that Im)  
Burn, burn, burning (There's a Dixie fire)  
Burn, burn, burning (Don't you know that Im)  
Burn, burn, burning  
Burn, burn, burning


Rolling down a backwoods Tennessee bighway  
One arm on the wheel  
Holding my lover with the other  
A sweet soft southern thrill  
Worked hard all week  
Got a little jingle  
On a Tennessee Saturday night  
Couldn't feel better  
I'm together with my dixieland delight  
  
Spend my dollar  
Parked in a holler 'neath the mountain moonlight  
Holdin' her up tight  
Make a little lovin'  
A little turtle dovin' on a Mason Dixon night  
It's my life  
Oh so right  
My dixieland delight  
  
Whitetail buck deer munchin' on clover  
Red-tailed hawk sitting on a limb  
Chubby ol' groundhog  
Croakin' bullfrog  
Free as a feeling in the wind  
Home grown country girl  
Gonna give me a whirl  
On a Tennessee Saturday night  
Lucky as a seven  
Livin' in Heaven  
With my dixieland delight  
  
Spend my dollar  
Parked in a holler 'neath the mountain moonlight  
Holdin' her up tight  
Make a little lovin'  
A little turtle dovin' on a Mason Dixon night  
It's my life  
Oh so right  
My dixieland delight  
  
Spend my dollar  
Parked in a holler 'neath the mountain moonlight  
Holdin' her up tight  
Make a little lovin'  
A little turtle dovin' on a Mason Dixon night  
It's my life  
Oh so right  
My dixieland delight  
  
Rolling down a backwoods Tennessee bighway  
One arm on the wheel


Gonna lay down my burdens, down by the riverside  
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside  
Gonna lay down my burdens, down by the riverside  
Ain't a-gonna study war no more  
  
Ain't a-gonna study war no more

Just off of the beaten path  
A little dot on a state road map  
That's where I was born and where I'll die  
Things move at a slower pace  
Nobody's in the rat race  
And these days that's a special way of life  
  
[Chorus]  
Down home, where they know you by name  
And treat you like family  
Down home, a man's good word and hand shake  
Are all you need  
Folks know if they're falling on hard times  
They can fall back on  
Those of us raised up down home  
  
In the corner of the hardware store  
Gathered 'round a checkerboard  
Old men telling lies and crowning kings  
Kids driving 'round the old town square  
Tops rolled down in the cool night air  
Go and see what's shaking at the Dairy Queen  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I was a boy, I couldn't wait to leave this place  
But now I want to see my children raised down home, down home  
  
Folks know if they're falling on hard times  
They can fall back on  
Those of us raised up...  
  
[Chorus]


She sits and stares out the window at the water  
Every night down at [Incomprehensible] Cafe  
All alone she sips her pina colada  
Talkin' to herself, dreamin' time away  
The story is that a dark haired stranger  
Stole her heart many years ago  
He promised her, he'd come back and take her  
Around the world, bring her hills of gold  
Down on Longboat Key  
Where the island sand meets the Gulf Stream Bridge  
Down on Longboat Key  
She spends her life in a dream on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key  
Each afternoon as the snug boats come in  
She runs to meet them down at the pier  
She sees the fishermen, the nets and the sunset  
But she don't see him, her eyes fill with tears  
She stands there lookin' at the crystal blue water  
And in the coral she imagines pearls  
She makes believe, he brought them all the way from China  
Then the water swirls, the blue-green water swirls  
Down on Longboat Key  
Where the island sand meets the Gulf Stream Bridge  
Down on Longboat Key  
She spends her life in a dream on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key  
Young sailors make a play to take her home  
She says, "No, I'm already taken"  
Oh, they just laugh when she mentions his name  
She just keeps on waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting  
Down on Longboat Key  
Where the island sand meets the Gulf Stream Bridge  
Down on Longboat Key  
She spends her life in a dream  
Down on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key yeah yeah  
Down on Longboat Key  
Where the island sand meets the Gulf Stream Bridge  
Down on Longboat Key  
Down on Longboat Key yeah yeah  
Down on Longboat Key  


Down on the river, it's an easy kind of life  
Everybody here's feeling fine  
No need to worry or get in a hurry  
Nothing to spend but time  
  
Light up a smoke and tell a few jokes  
And pass the old jug around  
We're gonna get right on a Saturday night  
When the sun goes down  
  
Down on the river, down on the river  
Just some old boys a making a lot of noise  
Down on the river, down on the river, down on the river  
If anyone calls tell them, we're all down on the river  
  
Well, we'll go fishing by the light of the moon  
And bait them hooks by hand  
Early in the morning take them off the line  
Fry 'em all up in a pan  
  
We gotta get home while we still got a job  
Or we'll have to answer to the man  
And everybody knows we gotta go  
We'll be back again  
  
Down on the river, down on the river


Down this road there's an old brick house  
My mama cried the day that I moved out  
And my first summer job was pumpin' gas and fixin' flats  
But at Henry Walker's Texaco  
Down this road, down this road  
  
Down this road there's a maple tree  
In a cotton field where Jenny first kissed me  
And I can still remember the night she said good-bye  
I stood there like a fool and watched her go  
Down this road, down this road  
  
And it goes on forever  
And it goes by too fast  
It'll take you anywhere you want to go  
And every memory will bring you back  
  
Down this road there's a small white church  
Daddy lived his life by the preacher's word  
He raised me right, I could always feel his love  
Even when the angels called him home  
Down this road  
  
And it goes on forever  
And it goes by too fast  
It'll take you anywhere you want to go  
And every memory will bring you back  
  
Down this road  
Down this road  
Down this road


Thinking of the faces I've seen  
Back when I was young and green  
I was falling back then  
Now I'm workin' on building a fire  
And flirtin' with that ol' desire  
And fallin' again into the wind  
I fall in love again, I'm fallin' again  
Well you'd think that I would learn by now  
To keep from falling somehow  
But I'm fallin' again  
'Cause when I caught that look in your eyes  
That's when I realized  
I was fallin' again into the wind  
I fall in love again  
Fall, fall, fall, fallin' again  
Fall, fall, fall, fallin' again  
Fall, fall, fall, fallin' again  
I fall in love again  
Fallin' again into the wind  
Fall, fall, fall, fallin' again  
Fall, fall, fall, fallin' again  
I fall in love again  
Fallin' again into the wind


Fantasy, midnight and you and me.  
Ecstasy, spirits running wild and free.  
Take me away, away.  
  
Outside on a blanket in the moonlight, it feels right with my arns around you
tight.  
Laying under heaven watching the stars okay while me and you and mother  
Nature drift away.  
  
Fantasy, midnight and you and me.  
Ecstasy, spirits running wild and free.  
Take me away, away.  
  
Fantasy, midnight and you and me.  
Ecstasy, spirits running wild and free.  
Fantasy, midnight and you and me.  
Ecstasy, spirits running wild and free.  
Take me away, away.  
Take me away, away.


Whisper to me softly, breathe words upon my skin  
No one's near and listening, so please don't say goodbye  
Just hold me close and love me, press your lips to mine  
Mmm feels so right. Feels so right.  
  
Lying here beside you I hear the echoes of your sighs  
Promise me you'll stay with me and keep me warm tonight  
So hold me close and love me, give my heart a smile  
Mmm feels so right. Feels so right.  
  
Your body feels so gentle and my passion rises high  
You're loving me so easy, you're wish is my command  
Just hold me close and love me, tell me it won't end  
Mmm feels so right. Feels so right.  
  
Feels so right.  
  
Ah, you feel so right baby...


He was a stranger in a little town  
She was sittin' alone in a crowd  
Listening to the old jukebox playin' a song  
From the moment we walked through the diner door  
She felt something like never before  
A feelin' so strong right from the start  
It wouldn't stop - it was more than a spark  
  
[Chorus:]  
Fire on fire they were burnin' up  
Over a coffee cup, under the table they touched  
Fire on fire, in each others eyes they just had to try  
'cause fire on fire just won't die  
  
It was gettin' late but they had all night  
They sat there talkin' 'bout their lives  
He was sellin', she uas gettin' ready to buy  
That ole neon light was glowin' dim  
But he could see by the way she was lookin' at him  
Tonight would be different, somethin' had changed  
His lonely heart was feelin' a flame  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
[Bridge]  
She needed him, he needed her  
And they both knew, without a word  
There was no question, there was no doubt  
There was no way they could put it out  
  
Fire on fire they were burnin' up  
Over a coffee cup, under the table they touched  
Fire on fire, in each other's eyes they just had to try  
'cause fire on fire, fire on fire  
Fire on fire just won't die  
  
Tag  
Fire on fire  
Just won't die  
Fire on fire


There are people in this country who work hard every day  
Not for fame or fortune do they strive  
But the fruits of their labor are worth more than their pay  
And it's time a few of them were recognized  
Hello Detroit auto workers, let me thank you for your time  
You work a forty hour week for a livin' just to send it on down the line  
Hello Pittsburgh steel mill workers, let me thank you for your time  
You work a forty hour week for a livin', a-just to send it on down the line  
This is for the one who swings the hammer, driving home the nail  
Or the one behind the counter, ringing up the sale  
Or the one who fights the fires, the one who brings the mail  
For everyone who works behind the scenes  
You can see them every morning in the factories and the fields  
In the city streets and the quiet country towns  
Working together like spokes inside a wheel  
They keep this country turning around  
Hello Kansas wheat field farmer, let me thank you for your time  
You work a forty hour week for a livin',a-just to send it on down the line  
Hello West Virginia coal miner, let me thank you for your time  
You work a forty hour week for a livin', just to send it on down the line  
This is for the one who drives the big rig, up and down the road  
Or the one out in the warehouse, bringing in the load  
Or the waitress, the mechanic, the policeman on patrol  
For everyone who works behind the scenes  
With a spirit you can't replace with no machine  
Hello America let me thank you for your time  


Just punched the clock and boy, am I ready?  
Walkin' out the door headin' home  
It's time to buckle up again in my rolling hunk of tin  
It's quittin' time the evenin' race is on  
It's that five o'clock 500 and I run it every day  
Pick up trucks, cars and buses all in my way  
We've got Darrel, we've got Dale, Richard, Mark, Rusty and Jeff  
Oh, the boss just dropped the green we're on our way  
It's that five o'clock 500 every day  
Oh, Bubba's runnin' right on my bumper  
Pushin' me but there's no where to go  
Lane changin' left and right, blowin' horns and blinkin' lights  
Oh, the fast lane has never been so slow  
It's that five o'clock 500 and I run it every day  
Pick up trucks, cars and buses all in my way  
We've got Darrel, we've got Dale, Richard, Mark, Rusty and Jeff  
Oh, the boss just dropped the green we're on our way  
It's that five o'clock 500 every day  
Well, the caution is out we're at a stand still  
Heard there's construction up ahead  
Won't be long so they say, soon we'll all be on our way  
Some trucker on the CB just said  
It's that five o'clock 500 and I run it every day  
Pick up trucks, cars and buses all in my way  
We've got Darrel, we've got Dale, Richard, Mark, Rusty and Jeff  
Oh, the boss just dropped the green we're on our way  
It's that five o'clock 500, five o'clock 500, five o'clock 500 every day  
Every day, every day, every day  
Five o'clock 500  


My dad was a big man with a will that was tough  
He was at his best when the going was rough  
He made a living for the family and never had to cheat  
To keep food on the table and shoes on our feet  
  
We sat down at the table and thanked god in prayer  
Cause we had plenty to eat and plenty to wear  
We had patches on our britches but momma kept us neat  
We had food on the table and shoes on our feet  
  
We picked the cotton and gathered the corn  
We were taught to work from the day we were born  
Mom and dad and all us children worked in the summer's heat  
To keep food on the table and shoes on our feet  
  
When you sit down at the table thank god in prayer  
If you've got plenty to eat and plenty to wear  
If you've got patches on your britches just be sure to keep em neat  
If you've got food on the table and shoes on your feet


I'll admit I could feel it  
The first time that we touched  
And the look in your eyes  
Said you felt as much  
  
But I'm not a man  
Who falls too easily  
It's best that you know  
Where you stand with me  
  
[Chorus]  
I will give you my heart  
Faithful and true  
And all the love it can hold  
That's all I can do  
'cause I've thought about  
How long I'll love you  
And it's only fair that you know  
Forever's as far as I'll go  
  
When there's age around my eyes  
And gray in your hair  
And it only takes a touch  
To recall the love we've shared  
  
I won't take for granted  
You'll know my love is true  
'cause each night in your arms  
I'll whisper to you  
  
[Chorus]

Forever's as far as I'll go


Wish I had just one more chance to hold you close and say I love you.  
Can't believe out romance was just beginning. Now its Through.  
I'm looking for tomorrow to start a newlife on my own.  
And all I see is sorrow. You're all I lived for. Now you're gone.  
I can't seem to get you off my mind no matter what I do.  
I'm trying to wipe you from my eyes, but the tears keep fallin' through.  
The hardest thing that love has put me through is gettin' over you, gettin'  
Over you, over you, over you.  


Life ain't all that easy I can testify to that  
It's been up and down and round and round to get to where I'm at  
If you could see how I'm living in this old car I drive  
Well you'd probably wonder and even ponder why I even want to stay alive  
  
So give me one more shot I'll give it all I've got  
Let me open my eyes to a new sunrise I pray  
Give me one more chance I'll learn to dance the dance  
Well I'm satisfied just being alive give me one more day  
  
Well I could complain about taxes or the weather we're having today  
Go on and on about things that are wrong from New York to L.A.  
Well that's just not my nature to sit around feeling sad  
We're only here for awhile so why not smile hey living ain't all that bad  
  
So give me one more shot I'll give it all I've got  
Let me open my eyes to a new sunrise I pray  
Give me one more chance I'll learn to dance the dance  
Well I'm satisfied just being alive give me one more day  
  
When I look around there's lots of folks worse off than me  
So I just thank the good Lord and ask him please  
  
So give me one more shot I'll give it all I've got  
Let me open my eyes to a new sunrise I pray  
Give me one more chance I'll learn to dance the dance  
Well I'm satisfied just being alive give me one more day  
  
Well I'm satisfied just being alive give me one more day  
Give me one more shot I'll give it all I've got  
Give me one more day  
Show me the way and give me one more day  
Give me one more shot


Can this be true? Tell me, can this be real?  
  
How can I put into words what I feel?  
My life was complete, I thought I was whole  
Why do I feel like I'm losing control?  
Never knew that love could feel like this,  
And you changed my world with just one kiss.  
How can it be that right here with me there's an angel?  
It's a miracle  
  
Your love is like a river peaceful and deep  
Your soul is like a secret That I could never keep  
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true  
God must of spent A little more time On you  
  
In all of creation, all things great and small  
You are the one that surpasses them all  
More precious than any diamond or pearl  
They broke the mold when you came in this world  
And I'm trying hard to figure out just how I ever did without  
The warmth of your smile, the heart of a child  
That's deep inside, leaves me purified  
  
Your love is like a river peaceful and deep  
Your soul is like a secret That I could never keep  
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true  
God must of spent A little more time On you  
  
Never thought that love could feel like this  
Then you change my world with just one kiss  
How can it be that right here with me  
There's an angel, is just a miracle  
  
Your love is like a river peaceful and deep  
Your soul is like a secret That I could never keep  
When I look into your eyes I know that it's true  
God must of spent A little more time On you  
  
God must have spent a little more time on you


[Chorus]  
Gonna have a party, a rockin' little jamboree.  
Gonna have a party. Come on along with me.  
Gonna have a good time, ev'rybody's feelin' right.  
Gonna have a party a week from Saturday night.  
  
Well, thought I'd call you early,  
I thought you'd like to know there's gonna be a party, and I'd love for you to
go.  
I just want to give you time to get your story right.  
There's gonna be a party, babe, and it might last all night.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now we're gonna play some music, and we can sing along.  
And I'll bet before the night is through, we'll play your favorite song.  
And when they play the slow dance and I'm holding you so tight, that's when
the party's startin', babe, and it might last all night.  
  
[Chorus]


Before I fly and wave goodbye  
I say to you "days with you are the best years of my life"  
But if I don't see you anymore  
Keep my words safely stored  
And i'll be back I promise once more  
  
Chorus:  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Till I see you again  
Goodbye, goodbye  
I'll love and i'll miss you till then  
  
Remember me 'cause I care  
Where you are and how you fare  
Get in touch if the wind blows in your face  
I guess it's been too much fun  
We've shared and we've won  
Yes the best is yet to come  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
That one word hurts so bad  
You leave the best you've had  
But you keep the faith and pray to return  
  
Goodbye, goodbye  
I'll love and i'll miss you till then  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye

Take me back down where cool water flows, y'all  
Let me remember the things I've done  
Walk on the log where the catfish bite  
Walking along the river road at night  
Barefoot girl, dancin' in the moonlight  
I can hear the bullfrog calling me, "Ribbit"  
Wonderin' if my rope's still hangin' to the tree  
Ole Brody Junior took me over  
Said, "You're gonna find a well that's colder  
If I'm a bad boss, give some O'Green river", well  
Take me back down where cool water flows, y'all  
Let me remember the things I've done  
Walk on the log where the catfish bite  
Walking along the river road at night  
Barefoot girl, dancin' in the moonlight  
Well  


I live to work and work to live  
Oh but what i wouldn't give  
For a ray of sun and a little piece of beach  
Where the sand dollar is the only currency

I vote we go to the gulf of mexico  
You and me by the sea  
Palm trees call me, oh that's the place i want to be  
Down where the southern breezes blow  
On the Gulf of Mexico  
  
Right at five o'clock today  
I'll pick you up, we'll drive away  
And i can't wait to feel the sand beneath my toes  
And i can almost see the sunburn on your nose

Vamos we go... (repeat chorus again)

Snowy days and frosty night, everything looks cold and white

I've been goin' around in a whirlwind not knowing which way to go.  
I've been lost in a jungle of heartaches looking for what I don't know  
I've spread my wings and I've done some things that I never meant to do.  
Its took me some time but I've made up my mind, I'm hanging up my travelin
shoes.  
  
[Chorus]  
Hangin' up my travelin shoes.  
My runnin' around is all through.  
I'm foldin' my wings up for you.  
I'm hangin' up my travelin' shoes.  
  
I've been ridin' a sea of uncertainty, runnin' away fom is all.  
I've listened to nothing that life had to tell me,  
Watched all my dreams rise and fall.  
I've made my mistakes, but it's not too late to pull myself out of the blues.  
Its took me some time but I've made up my mind, I'm hanging up my travelin
shoes.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hangin' up travelin' shows.


Happy birthday, Jesus, it's that time of year  
All the lights on the trees say Christmas time is near  
Another year's behind us, you helped us make it through  
So, happy birthday, Jesus, this song is just for you  
  
We all get so hung up on material things at times it seems like we forget  
What Christmas really means  
It should be thanks we're givin', that's why I wrote this tune  
Happy birthday, Jesus, this sing is just for you  
  
There's a gift for everyone but you underneath the tree  
No, it's not much, but I hope you like this song to you from me  
  
Happy birthday Jesus, that's why I wrote this tune  
So, happy birthday, Jesus, my song is just for you


Smilin' faces on city streets, crowded shoppers, busy feet  
And every smile just seems to say, we're having some happy holidays  
  
Twinklin' lights on Christmas trees, kids up on santa's kneww  
Busy lines on telephones, sending a merry Christmas home  
  
Bells ringing everywhere, season spirit in the air  
Up and down the avenue, holiday dreams comin' true  
  
A choir singing songs of cheer, carols we all love to hear  
Rudolph with his glowin' nose, lovers under mistletoe  
  
Postman bringin' Christmas cards, reindeer out in the yard  
Frosty with his eyes of coal, present wrapped in pretty bows  
  
Sidewalks full of happy eyes, flakes fallin' from the sky  
Boys and girls at the big parade to see st. nick up on his sleigh  
  
The scene is set, it's beautiful, sounds of peace, joy and love  
From all of us we'd like to say, have yourself some happy holidays


The stage is set tonight down in Nashville  
It's been a long, hard ride into town  
And thanks to some cowboys and heros  
My chance to sing has finally come around  
  
The first song I ever sang was haggard  
Momma sang to me I saw the Light  
I'd turn my radio up louder  
To hear Johnny Cash walk the line  
  
Waylon sang a song about Texas  
Willie's "Blue Eyes Crying In The Rain"  
Bocephus sings a song about dixie.  
Lefty taught us all how to sing.  
  
Hats off to hard riding cowboys  
Riding some where tonight  
Hats off to hard riding cowboys  
Wanted, dead or alive  
  
Charlie ran the devil out of Georgia  
Skynyrd sang sweet home Alabam  
The Ahlman brothers taught us how to ramble  
And to Tucker boys showed us how to jam.  
  
Hats off to hard riding cowboys  
Riding some where tonight  
Hats off to hard riding cowboys  
Wanted, dead or alive  
  
The stage is set tonight up in Heaven  
Rebas band is there with Patsy Cline  
And all around are cowboys and cowgirls  
And thanks to them the music's still alive  
  
Hats off to hard riding cowboys  
Flying somewhere tonight  
Hats off to hard fighting cowboys  
Wanted, dead or alive  
  
Hats off to hard riding cowboys  
Flying somewhere tonight  
Hats off to hard fighting cowboys  
Wanted, dead or alive


Well, I was feeling kinda lonely, just a little bit blue  
All I wanted was someone to talk to  
I wasn't looking for love or a do romance  
I had no intention of taking that big chance  
Until she walked in, in that low-cut dress  
She was a first class ticket on Heartbreak Express  
  
Well, punch my ticket, I'm headin' on down the line  
First stop misery, here I go one more time  
Destination dead ahead, ain't that loneliness  
I got a first class ticket on Heartbreak Express  
  
Well, I ought a know better, you think I'm learned  
But if you're gonna chase fire, you're gonna get burned!  
Yeah, I was still gettin' over the hurtin' from the one before  
She walked in right through that ballroom door  
I ain't never been one to settle for second best  
I want a first class ticket on Heartbreak Express  
  
Well, punch my ticket, I'm headin' on down the line  
First stop misery, here I go one more time  
Destination dead ahead ain't that loneliness  
I got a first class ticket on Heartbreak Express  
  
Punch my ticket, I'm headin' on down the line  
First stop misery, here I go one more time  
Destination dead ahead, ain't that loneliness  
I got a first class ticket on Heartbreak Express  
  
I got a first class ticket on Heartbreak Express  
I got a first class ticket, Heartbreak Express  
I got a first class ticket on a Heartbreak Express  
I got a first class ticket, Heartbreak Express


Here we are, once again  
Stronger now than we have ever been  
Hand in hand, heart to heart  
Now we made it through the hardest part  
We had to break it all down to build it back up  
Lean on each other when the times got rough  
How we survive going through so much  
Baby you and I could write a book about love  
Here we are, one to one  
Looking back to see how far we come  
We shared it all, you and I  
We're still together after all this time  
We had to break it all down to build it back up  
Lean on each other when the times got rough  
How we survive going through so much  
Baby you and I could write a book about love  
Here we are, once again  
We're stronger now than we have ever been  
With hand in hand, with heart to heart  
Here we are, here we are  
Here we are  
Here we are  
Here we are

Hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
Hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
  
When I saw you walking down the street  
I said that's the kind of girl I'd like to meet  
She's so pretty, Lord she's fine. I'm gonna make her mine all mine  
  
Hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
  
When you turned and walked away, that's when I want to say now  
Come on baby give me a whirl, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
  
Hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
  
When you turned and walked away, that's when I wanna say  
Come on baby give me a whirl, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
  
Hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
Hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl  
Hey, hey, hey, hey baby, I wanna know if you'll be my girl


We didn't know the times were lean,  
Round our house the grass was green,  
It didn't seem like things were all that bad,  
  
I bet we walked a thousand miles,  
Choppin' cotton and pusing plows,  
And learnin' how to give it all we had.  
  
As Life went on and years went by,  
I saw the light in daddy's eye,  
And felt the love in mamma's hands,  
They kept us warm and kept us fed,  
Taught us how to look ahead,  
Now lookin' back I understand.  
  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old times there are not forgotten,  
Those fertile fields are never far away,  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old time there are not forgotten,  
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.  
  
When Sunday mornings rolled around,  
We dressed up hand-me-downs,  
Just in time to gather with the church,  
Some times I think how long It's been,  
And how it impressed me then,  
It was the only day my daddy wouldn't work.  
  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old times there are not forgotten,  
Those fertile fields are never far away,  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old time there are not forgotten,  
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.  
  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old times there are not forgotten,  
Those fertile fields are never far away,  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old time there are not forgotten,  
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.  
  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old times there are not forgotten,  
Those fertile fields are never far away,  
We were walkin' in high cotton,  
Old time there are not forgotten,  
Leavin' home was the hardest thing we ever faced.  
  
Walkin' in High Cotton


Why should I feel discouraged?  
And why should the shadows come?  
And why should my heart be lonely  
And long for heaven and home?  
  
When Jesus is my portion  
My constant friend is He  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches me  
  
And I sing because I'm happy  
I sing because I am free  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches me  
  
Let not your heart be troubled  
His tender word I hear  
And resting on His goodness  
I lose my doubts and fears  
  
Though by the path He leads us  
But one step I may see  
His eye is on the sparrows  
And I know He watches me  
  
And I sing because I'm happy  
And I sing because I'm free  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches me  
  
His eye is on the sparrow  
And I know He watches me


Atlanta, Georgia made her the Cotton Queen  
L.A. bound she had visions of the silver screen  
But Hollywood ain't nothin' but glamor and lights  
To a blue-eyed blond with stars in her eyes  
Her days are long. Lord, her nights are longer yet  
Tryin' to find a part that will make her the Queen of sex  
She's realizing what it's all about from too many nights upon the casting
couch  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hollywood: parties and thrills  
The mansion in her mind is somewhere is Beverly Hills  
She's been discovered too many times standing on the corner of Hollywood and
Vine  
  
She makes her entrance now a days through the swingin' doors  
She found her stage on a hardwood barroom floor  
But it's not the bottom, just part of a long, hard fall  
Her biggest fan's the man. Tonight she'll give her all  
The dream is dyin' of her name on the marquee  
The folks back home wonder what happened to their Queen  
The mornin' papers told it in black and white, calling it another Hollywood
suicide  
  
[Chorus:]


I'm gonna call up my boss and tell him I'm ill  
Gonna tell him I'm home, with the fever and chills  
I don't usually lie but for your sweet love I will, I need it so  
  
We won't be disturbed, the phone's off the hook  
And when it comes to lovin' woman, you wrote the book  
And I just saw that 'I want you' look and that's all it took, well I  
  
Ain't got no business doin' business today  
My little woman wants to stay home and play  
Right in her arms is where I will stay  
'Cause I ain't got no business doin' business today  
  
Well, the boys at the plant are punching the clock  
If they could see us darlin', oh, what a shock  
They'd do the same if they had what I got  
So please don't stop, well I  
  
Ain't got no business doin' business today  
My little woman wants to stay home and play  
Right in her arms is where I will stay  
'Cause I ain't got no business doin' business today  
  
Ain't got no business doin' business today  
My little woman wants to stay home and play  
Right in her arms is where I will stay  
'Cause I ain't got no business doin' business today


I've rehearsed this day a thousand times  
I've played this scene out in my mind  
You spread your wings, you need to fly  
It breaks my heart to say goodbye  
These arms of mine want to pull you close  
But I love you enough to let you go  
  
My mind goes back to memories  
Of pony rides upon my knee  
First day of school, your brand new bike  
And football games on Friday nights  
And through the years I've watched you grow  
And I love you enough to let you go  
  
Don't look back when you drive away  
I don't want to change your mind  
I know in all your eighteen years  
You've never seen your daddy cry  
  
So many things I want to say  
You'll meet new friends, you'll be okay  
I'll pray for you out on your own  
But don't forget your way back home  
And though I may not let it show  
I love you enough to let you go  
  
Don't look back when you drive away  
I don't want to change your mind  
I know in all your eighteen years  
You've never seen your daddy cry  
  
These arms of mine want to pull you close  
But I love you enough to let you go


I lay out some paper, I take out my pen  
Turn on my table lamp and here I go again  
It's time to write a letter, I'm in the mood tonight  
Gotta find a way to tell you how I feel inside  
  
So I write a little,  
And I cry a little  
It's so hard to find a way  
To say goodbye a little  
But somewhere in the middle  
My emotions interfere  
So I write it a little,  
And cry a little tear  
And I've died a little,  
Wishing you were here  
  
God I miss you  
Can't be with you  
I would kiss you oh so good  
'Cause you're my only cure for lonely  
I'd call if I could  
  
Well I've died a little,  
Wishing you were here  
Wishing you were here  
Well I'm writing a little,  
And wishing you were here  
And I write a little,  
And I cry a little tear  
And I'm writing,  
And wishing you were here


Your love for me is gone  
But my love for you lives on  
And my memories of you  
Will never die  
  
I can just see you now  
The special smile you gave to me  
The face I'll love eternally  
I see all the things you do  
  
Your nearness seems so real to me  
As though you really care with me  
Can't believe it's just a memory  
I can just see you now  
  
Oh, girl if I only could  
I wish with all my heart I could  
Holding you would feel so good  
If I could just see you now  
  
I can just feel you now  
The tender sweetness of your lips  
As they brush across my fingertips  
I feel the softness on your mind  
  
So warm beside through the night  
Holding you to the morning light  
Oh, did you really say goodbye  
I can just feel you now  
  
Oh, girl if I only could  
I wish with all my heart I could  
Holding you would feel so good  
If I could just see you now  
  
I could just see you now  
The special smile you gave to me  
The face I'll love eternally  
I see all the things you do


If I Had You  
Alabama  
Album: For The Record  
  
If I had you we'd run like gypsies in the wind  
We'd be lovers and we'd be friends, if I had you  
If I had you we'd count the stars all one by one  
We'd make love till they were gone oh, if I had you  
  
'Cause you light a fire way down in my soul  
The flame keeps growin' stronger  
'Cause there ain't no control  
And there's nothing, no there's nothing  
No there's nothing that I wouldn't do, if I had you  
  
If I had you, we'd sail the seven seas as one  
We'd never say it can't be done, oh, if I had you  
  
'Cause you light a fire way down in my soul  
The flame keeps growin' stronger there ain't no control  
And there's nothing, oh, there's nothing  
I know there's nothing that I wouldn't do, if I had you  
If I had you...


Oh I love those Colorado Rockies  
And that big starry Montana sky  
And the lights of San Francisco  
On a California night  
Enjoyed those ballgames in Chicago  
On those windy afternoons  
It' s a big beautiful country  
But I' m never home too soon  
If it ain' t Dixie, it won' t do  
  
If it ain' t Dixie it don' t feel quite like home  
My southern blood runs deep and true  
I' ve had good times  
North of the line  
I' ve got a lot of good friends too  
But if it ain' t Dixie, it won' t do  
It won' t do  
  
When the leaves turn in New England  
I love the chill that' s in the air  
I' ve walked the New York City sidewalks  
Had a big time in Times Square  
But now my wheels are rollin' southward  
And heaven' s comin' into view  
Home-sweet-home is Alabama  
That' s what I look forward to  
  
If it ain' t Dixie it don' t feel quite like home  
My southern blood runs deep and true  
I' ve had good times  
North of the line  
I' ve got a lot of good friends too  
If it ain' t Dixie, it won' t do  
It won' t do  
  
If it ain' t Dixie  
Oh no, Oh no-whoah  
  
Now my wheels are rollin' southward  
And heaven' s comin' into view  
Home-sweet-home is Alabama  
That' s what I look forward to  
  
Y' all come to Dixie...


If you're gonna play in texas,  
You gotta have a fiddle in the band.  
That lead guitar is hot,  
But not for "lousiana man".  
So rosin up that bow for "faded love"  
And let's all dance.  
If you're gonna play in texas,  
You gotta have a fiddle in the band.  
  
I remember down in houston  
We were puttin' on a show  
When a cowboy in the back stood up and yelled,  
"cotton-eyed joe"!  
He said, "we love what you're doin'.  
Boys don't get us wrong,  
There's just somethin' missin' in your song.  
  
Chorus  
  
So we dusted off our boots and put our cowboy hats on straight.  
Them texans raised the roof when jeff opened up his case.  
You say y'all all wanna two-step. You say ya wanna doe-si-doe.  
Well, here's a fiddlin' song before we go.  
  
Chorus  
Repeat and fade


Chorus:  
  
I'm in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun  
All I really got to do is live and die  
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why  
  
Don't know why  
I have to drive so fast  
My car has nothing to prove  
It's not new, but it'll do 0 to 60 in 5.2  
  
Chorus  
  
Can't be late  
That leaves me plenty of time  
Shakin' hands with the clock  
I can't stop, I'm on a roll and ready to rock  
  
Chorus  
  
I hear a voice  
It says I'm runnin' behind  
I better pick up my pace  
It's a race and there ain't no room  
For someone in second place  
  
Break  
  
Chorus  


I'm in a hurry to get things done  
Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why.

I have to drive so fast  
My car has nothing to prove  
It's not new  
But it'll do 0 to 60 in 5.2

Oh I rush and rush until life's no fun  
All I really gotta do is live and die  
But I'm in a hurry and don't know why

There's something sexy 'bout the way you're dressed  
I can see you're lookin' your best tonight, that's right  
You're walkin' with a new attitude  
There's something different 'bout the way you're movin' tonight, that's right  
But before we walk out the door, let me say one thing more  
  
Save one last dance for our bedroom  
Baby, I'm in that kind of mood  
There ain't no tellin' what we might do  
When it's all over and the night is through  
Baby, how 'bout you, I'm in that kind of mood  
  
It's been a while since we've been out  
It's overdue baby ain't no doubt you know, ain't it so  
It's feelin' like our first date  
To tell the truth now honey I can't wait to go  
And I think you know  
Well tonight it's just us two and baby I want you  
  
But before we walk out the door, let me say one thing more  
Save one last dance for our bedroom  
Baby, I'm in that kind of mood  
There ain't no tellin' what we might do  
When it's all over and the night is through  
Baby, how 'bout you, I'm in that kind of mood  
  
But before we walk out the door, let me say one thing more  
Save one last dance for our bedroom  
Baby, I'm in that kind of mood  
There ain't no tellin' what we might do  
When it's all over and the night is through  
Baby, how 'bout you, I'm in that kind of mood  
  
I'm in that kind of mood  
I'm in that kind of mood  
I'm in that kind of mood


I knock off with a lot on my mind  
From a long hard day  
Pull in at home, see you and find  
My stress slipping away  
Then you run to my arms  
and give me a kiss  
And nothing else matters  
When you hold me like this  
  
(Chorus)  
Girl, I'm in the mood to be your man  
To win your heart all over again  
Let my eyes trace, let my lips taste  
Nothing but you  
I'm in the mood to close the door  
Make love tonight like never before  
Rush after rush, like waves on the shore  
Girl, I'm in the mood  
All day long I'm so strong  
Then I hear you speak  
I'm drawn to your fire, your signs of desire  
Girl, you make me weak  
I go drifting away  
Like a leaf in the wind  
I'm under a spell  
Your touch put me in  
Girl, I'm in the mood to be your man  
To win your heart all over again  
Let my eyes trace, let my lips taste  
Nothing but you  
Yeah, I'm in the mood to close the door  
Make love tonight like never before  
Rush after rush, like waves on the shore  
Girl, I'm in the mood


We used to get crazy ev'ry Saturday night  
We'd drive into town and get feelin' right  
A child of the sixties in seventy four  
But I'm not that way anymore  
  
Well I burned the tires off my chevrolet  
Tryin' to impress the girls that I date  
And I'd bet a gambler when I couldn't score  
But I'm not that way anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm not that way anymore  
Time's closin' yesterday's door  
But I'm just as happy as I was before  
Cause I'm not that way anymore  
  
American bandstand, the sullivan show  
I listened to the opry on my ra--dee---I--o  
Well dick clark's still lookin' as young as before  
But I'm not that way anymore  
  
Well I swapped my loafers for cowboy boots  
Bought me some jeans gave away all my suits  
My razor is rusted, my barber is poor  
'Cause I'm not that way anymore  
  
I'm not that way anymore  
We're not that way anymore


I know people who lose their lover turn around and they find another  
Fall in love and then they break up I don't know if I want to wake up  
Cause I'm still dreamin' I'm still dreamin' baby  
I'm still dreamin' oh oh oh about you  
Other women walk right up to me I hear them talking but it goes right through
me  
I know it's love that's on the line but they don't know what's on my mind  
Cause I'm still dreamin'...  
It's like a voice that's always calling it's like a feelin' that I'm always
falling  
I close my eyes and all I see is you you you  
Cause I'm still dreamin'...  
I'm still dreamin'...  
  


Sittin' here and rinkin'. Hey that's my fav'right song.  
What's that that Ihear ringin'? Would someone get the phone?  
Wond'rin if she'll ever come home.  
I've had no sleep, sad songs. I'm stoned.  
Our love, a fadin mem'ry as I chase another down.  
My eyes are gettin' heavy and my head's spinnin' 'round.  
Stil wond'rin if she'll ever come home.  
I've had no sleep, sad songs, I'm stoned.  
Closing time, I drive for home not feelin' any pain.  
Thoughts of her drift back tome through the fallin' rain.  
Not caring if she ever come shome.  
I've had no sleep, sad songs. I'm stoned.  
I've had no sleep, sad songs. I'm stoned.  
  


[Chorus]  
In the corner of my mind stands a jukebox  
It's playing all my favorite memories  
One by one they take me back  
To the days when you were mine  
And i can't stop this jukebox in my mind  
  
I don't need no quarters  
Don't need any dimes  
You filled it up forever  
When you said goodbye  
Heaven knows i love old melodies  
They were meant to ease the pain  
But the kind that's playing on my mind  
Are driving me insane  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Song by song those melodies  
Were meant to ease the pain  
But the kind that's playing on my mind  
Are driving me insane  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tag  
No i can't stop this jukebox in my mind  
  
[Chorus]


Katy brought my guitar back today  
I left it there to play when I'd stay over  
And I remember all those nights  
Sittin' in the fireplace light  
How she loved to hear me play  
And Katy brought my guitar back today  
  
Katy brought my guitar back today  
I've seen it make her cry over and over  
She told me when I wasn't there  
And she would wake up feelin' scared  
She'd hold it in her arms and be okay  
Katy brought my guitar back today  
  
We had our stormy times like anybody else  
Oh, more than once I broke her heart  
And when I couldn't tell her I was sorry by myself  
I could tell her with an old guitar  
But I'm afraid this time things have gone too far  
  
Katy brought my guitar back today  
I guess that means this time it's really over  
And as I sit and play it now  
The songs all seem so sad somehow  
I wish that I'd 've left it in the case  
Katy brought my guitar back today  
  
And I remember all those nights  
Sittin' in the fireplace light  
How she loved to hear me play  
But Katy brought my guitar back today


It's her first night on the town since she was just eighteen  
A lady down on love and out of hope and dreams  
The ties that once bound her now are broke away  
And she's like a baby, just learning how to play  
  
She never thought that love could ever end so soon  
Her mind drifts back in time to a mid-summer moon  
When he asked her to marry and she glady said O.K  
And a woman came to be from the girl of yesterday  
  
Now she's a lady down on love  
She needs somebody to gently pick her up  
She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound  
To a man who would love her and never let her down  
  
Well, I know a lady that's down on her love  
'Cause I used to hold her and have that special touch  
But work took me a way from home late at nights  
And I wasn't there when she turned out the lights  
Then both of us got lonely and I gave into lust  
And she just couldn't live with a man she couldn't trust  
  
Now she's a lady down on love  
She needs somebody to gently pick her up  
She's got her freedom, but she'd rather be bound  
To man who would love her and never let her down  
Now she's a lady down on love


You kiss me awake in the mornin'  
Now what a way to start the day  
With love notes that you leave me  
Written in your own special way  
  
You call me up for nothin'  
I hear your voice on the line  
We start talkin' 'bout lovin'  
You get to me everytime  
  
It's those little things you do that make me love you so  
Little things that only you and I could ever know  
You don't have to lay the whole wide world here at my feel, oh no  
It's those little things you do that mean the most to me  
  
Lyin' in the bed beside you  
Touchin' in the middle of the night  
No you don't have to do any talkin'  
To tell me everything is all right  
  
It's those little things you do that make me love you so  
Little things that only you and I will ever know  
You don't have to lay the whole wide world here at my feel, oh no  
It's those little things you do that mean the most to me  
  
It's those little things you do that mean the most to me


  
Well, you got to walk that lonesome valley  
You got to walk it by yourselves  
Nobody else can walk it for you  
You got to walk it by yourselves  
  
Now mother walked that lonesome valley  
She had to walk it by herself  
Cause nobody else could walk it for her  
She had to walk it by herself  
  
Now father walked that lonesome valley  
He had to walk it by himself  
Nobody else could walk it for him  
He had to walk it by himself  
  
Now John, they say, he was a Baptist  
While others say, he was a Jew  
But the holy bible plainly tells you  
Oh, that he was a preacher too  
  
Yeah, you got to walk that lonesome valley  
You got to walk it by yourselves  
Ain't nobody else gonna go there for you  
You got to go there by yourselves  
  
Yeah, we got to walk that lonesome valley  
We got to walk it by ourselves (by ourselves)  
Cause nobody else (nobody else) can walk it for us  
We got to walk it by ourselves  
  
Yeah, we got to walk (we got to walk)  
That lonesome valley (that lonesome valley)  
We got to walk (we got to walk) it by ourselves (by ourselves)  
Lord, nobody else (nobody else) can walk it for us  
(Can walk it for you)  
We got to walk (we got to walk) it by ourselves  
  
Yeah, we got to walk (we got to walk) it by ourselves  
  


I once thought of love as a prison  
a place I didn't want to be  
So long ago, I made a decision  
to be footloose and fancy-free  
  
But you came and I was so tempted  
to gamble on love just one time  
I never thought, that I would get caught  
It seemed like the perfect crime  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby you left me defense-less  
I've only got one plea  
Lock me away, inside of your love  
and throw away the key  
I'm guilty...of love in the first degree  
  
I thought it would be so simple  
like a thousand times before  
I'd take what I wanted, and just walk away  
but I never made it to the door  
  
Now babe I'm not beggin' for mercy  
go ahead and throw the book at me  
If lovin' you's a crime  
I know that I'm as guilty as a man can be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love in the first degree (oh-oh yeah)  
Love in the first degree  
Oh Yeeeaaaah!  
  
[Chorus]


I don't mind the cold and rain where I'm waiting  
I'm holding on to your mem'ry as tight as I can  
And silver wings are bringing you back so I can hold you  
And let me know that I'm still your lovin' man  
  
You carry my dreams through the darkness while I'm sleeping  
The part of love that I need to fit my plan  
And I don't need nobody else to ease my feelings  
As long as I can be your lovin' man  
  
I been waiting here for days to see that big steel bird arrive  
And just the thought of lovin' you is what's kept this man alive  
  
Share with me all the joy life can bring us  
Though my kingdows may be castles made of sand  
Darlin' please spend your sunshine days beside me  
And let me always be your lovin' man  
  
Your lovin' man (lovin' man)  
And let me be (your lovin' man)  
Your lovin' man (lovin' man)  
And let me be (your lovin' man)  
Your lovin' man (lovin' man)


Once upon a lifetime  
I looked in someone's eyes  
And felt the fire burning in my heart  
For the very first time  
She was scared and young  
And had never tasted love  
So I took her by the hand  
And a boy became a man  
Once upon a lifetime  
  
And once upon a lifetime  
You hold the Queen of Hearts  
And if you gamble on a diamond win  
The dealin' starts  
  
You stand to lose it all  
As the cards begin to fall  
And the lesson learned is hard  
You're only dealt the Queen of Cards  
Once upon a lifetime  
  
So if you're taking chances, know the chance you take  
A broken heart's a high price to pay  
Foolish ways will make fools of the wise  
And the best things seldom come along twice  
  
Once upon a lifetime  
You know that you've been blessed  
When you hold your first born tenderly against your chest  
  
And through the innocence you see  
The value of a family  
And you feel a special bond  
That only comes along  
Once upon a lifetime  
  
So if you're taking chances, know the chance you take  
A broken heart's a high price to pay  
Foolish ways will make fools of the wise  
And the best things seldom come along twice  
And people only find love like yours and mine  
Once upon a lifetime


We live in the land of plenty  
But many things aren't plenty anymore  
Like the water from our sink  
They say's not safe to drink  
  
You gotta go and buy it at the store  
Now we're told there's a hole in the ozone  
Look what's washing on the beach  
And Lord, I believe, from the heavens to the seas  
We're bringing Mother Nature to her knees  
  
[Chorus]  
So let's leave some blue up above us  
Let's leave some green on the ground  
It's only ours to borrow, let's save some for tomorrow  
Leave it and pass it on down  
  
Well there's a change taking place way on the mountains  
Acid rain is falling on the leaves  
And down in Brazil, the fires are burning still  
How we gonna breathe without them trees  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a place where I live called the Canyon  
Where Daddy taught me to swim  
And that water, it's so pure  
And I'm gonna make sure  
Daddy's grandkids can swim there like him  
  
Now we all oughta feel just a little bit guilty  
When we look into the eyes of our kids  
'Cause brothers it's a fact, if we take and don't put back  
They'll have to pay for all we did  
  
[Chorus: x 4]  
  
Tag:  
Leave it and pass it on down


Precious memories, flood my soul  
  
Precious memories, unseen angels  
Sent from somewhere to my soul  
How they linger ever near me  
And the sacred past unfolds  
  
Precious father and loving mother  
Fly across the lonely years  
And old home scenes of my childhood  
In fond memories appear  
  
As I travel on life's pathway  
Know not what the years may hold  
As I ponder, hope grows fonder  
Precious memories flood my soul  
  
In the stillness of the midnight  
Echo's from the past I hear  
Old time singing, gladness bringing  
From that lovely land somewhere  
  
Precious memories, how they linger  
How they ever flood my soul  
In the stillness of the midnight  
Precious sacred seems unfold  
  
Precious memories, how they linger  
How they ever flood my soul  
In the stillness of the midnight  
Precious sacred seems unfold


Let's roll the windows down, turn the radio up  
Let the wind blow through our hair  
Love is reckless  
Let's get reckless tonight  
  
There ain't nothin' out here but a big ol' Texas sky  
There's a red sun painted across the coming night  
Well, your daddy's got plans for you  
and mine thinks I'm at school  
They say it's reckless to chase a dream  
But this town's got nothing for you and me  
  
Let's roll the windows down, turn the radio up  
Let the wind blow through our hair  
There's a moon tonight and a road outside, baby  
We're gettin out of here.  
I could care less where it leads us  
Love is reckless let's get reckless tonight  
  
Let's take my Thunderbird and leave tonight,  
I'll keep the pedal to the floor till we see the morning light.  
They can't live our lives for us,  
If we let them we'll lose our love.  
And love dies hard in this Texas sun,  
I'd rather be reckless and on the run  
  
Let's roll the windows down, turn the radio up  
Let the wind blow through our hair  
There's a moon tonight and a road outside, baby  
We're gettin out of here.  
I could care less where it leads us  
Love is reckless let's get reckless tonight  
  
When you're crazy in love you gotta take a chance,  
Burn the bridge and don't look back.  
  
Turn the radio up roll the windows down  
Let the wind blow through our hair  
There's a moon tonight and a road outside,  
Baby we're gettin' out of here  
Roll the windows down.  
Turn the radio up


She can light a fire under me  
Give me all the courage that I need  
She can see a side I just can't see, she can  
  
She can make me smile when I wanna cry  
Find a way to change my state of mind  
She can always reach through my disguise, she can  
  
When my world gets crazy and I just can't cope  
She throws her arms around me and gives me hope  
When I got the desire but I got no plans  
I need someone to understand, oh, only she can  
  
She can take the chill out of winter nights  
Take away the wrong from what's not right  
She can make the darkest hour look bright, she can  
  
When I really need to make a stand  
But I don't believe in who I am  
When I really want to but I just can't, she can  
  
When my world gets crazy and I just can't cope  
She throws her arms around me and gives me hope  
When I got the desire but I got no plans  
I need someone to understand, oh, only she can  
  
I try to do for her what she does for me  
'Cause I want our love to grow  
I'm gonna hold on tightly only a fool would let her go  
  
'Cause when my world gets crazy and I just can't cope  
She throws her arms around me and gives me hope  
When I got the desire but I got no plans  
I need someone to understand, oh, only she can  
  
Yes, she can  
Only she can  
Yes, she can  
Oh, yes, she can [unverified]


There's a little cafe' on the corner of town  
Lucy works there 'til the sun goes down  
It ain't very much but she brings home the bacon and the bread  
  
We got a mortgage we pay just a little bit on  
But it seems like all of our money is gone  
Before we get a chance to get ahead  
That's small stuff, we don't sweat the small stuff  
  
Why worry about the mortgage and the minimum wage  
Traffic and the taxes and the coming of age  
Small stuff  
There's a comfort in the knowing there's a spirit in us  
Giving us the courage and the wisdom to trust  
In a love that's so much greater than all the small stuff  
So we don't sweat the small stuff  
  
There's a little bitty hole in the ceiling above  
Sometimes the rain drips down on our temple of love  
We have to put a pot smack dab in the middle of the bed  
Somebody hit my car at the diner last night  
Had to drive it home with one taillight  
When I went out this morning, the engine was dead  
That's small stuff, we don't sweat the small stuff  
  
Why worry about the mortgage and the minimum wage  
Traffic and the taxes and the coming of age  
Small stuff  
There's a comfort in the knowing there's a spirit in us  
Giving us the courage and the wisdom to trust  
In a love that's so much greater than all the small stuff  
So we don't sweat the small stuff  
  
There's a little cafe' on the corner of town  
Lucy works there 'til the sun goes down  
And she don't sweat the small stuff


It was July hot 'cross Georgia on my way to myrtle beach  
I just got my diploma so I set out in search of me  
The honeymoon was over and Alabama was far away  
From being little more than just a southern state  
  
I got a gig down at the Bowery  
I played for tip and watered drinks  
Just a novice in a business  
That's seldom what it seems  
  
And where are you goin' tar top  
Where's J.C. and the chosen few?  
I saw the flash without T.Gentry  
And B.V. left for Malibu  
  
I was July, hot and thirty, some years down the line  
When the boys touched the nation, unaware at the time  
I got to go to Texas, California, New York too  
A farm boy who is thankful to be standin' in his shoes  
  
But in the Bowery hangs the memories  
Of dreams that still come true  
Every time I see the spotlights  
I'm one of the chosen few  
  
And where are you going tar top  
J.C. and the chosen few  
There's no flash without T.Gentry  
B.V. where are you?  
  
Where are you goin' tar top  
Which direction will you take  
What's this contraband clamor  
About the music that you make?  
  
And where are you goin' tar top  
Is it country enough?  
Is it contemporary glamor?  
No it's us, just us


I was born across the river in the mountains where I call home.  
Lord, times were good there. don't know why i ever roamed.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, Tennessee river and a mountain man, we get together anytime we can.  
Oh, Tennessee river and a mountain man, we play together in mother nature's  
  
Band.  
  
Me and my woman's done made our plans on the Tennessee river, walkin' hand in  
Hand.  
Gonna raise a family, lord settle down where peace and love can still be  
Found.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, Tennessee river.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, Tennessee river.


He stays up at night till way after dark  
Feeding the dog that lives in our yard  
He'll put on my shoes and stumble around  
But together we can catch any outlaw in town  
The boy tries to be just like me  
I'm all that he tries to be  
Watching cartoons on my knee  
Mamma's little man and me  
He wants to know how this and that goes  
He'll play all day on a mountain of clay  
And he'll fight with me to show that he's strong  
But if he gets hurt it's mamma he wants  
The boy tries to be just like me  
I'm all that he tries to be  
Watching cartoons on my knee  
It's mamma's little man and me  
Some day I know he'll leave us alone  
Break mamma's heart I'll try to be strong  
But if I shed a tear I hope he won't see  
The big man is him and the boy is me  
The boy tried to be just like me  
He's all that I try to be  
Now I'm watching cartoons on my knees  
And mamma's little man is me  
Let's go to bed mamma  


You can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
'Cause nothing else shows a part of his soul  
Like she does  
And she'd be the one to swear that he hung  
The moon above  
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
  
She knows him inside out  
The things he dreams about  
And makes them come true when she can  
She knows all of his faults  
The demons he's fought  
With nothin' but his hard-workin' hands  
  
And he calls out her name  
In passion and pain  
She makes him stronger each time  
Yeah it's there on her lips  
And her fingertips  
That she's with him to 'til end of the line  
  
(Yeah) you can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves (yes you can)  
'Cause nothing else shows a part of his soul  
Like she does and she'd be the one to swear that he hung  
The moon above  
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
  
You can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
'Cause nothing else shows a part of his soul  
Like she does  
And she'd be the one to swear that he hung  
The moon above  
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
  
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man  
By the woman he loves  
He loves  
He always loves


We could walk away now  
Call it over and done  
Say we fought the good fight  
And nobody won  
  
Say we're both better off  
That worse came to worst  
So we didn't last  
Hey, we're not the first  
  
But then again  
If we give it one more try  
We might find the feeling  
Never really died  
And there's still a chance to be  
All we might have been  
And find the love we had back then again  
  
Off to such a good start  
But somehow it seems  
We've let our hearts  
Fall apart at the dreams  
  
We could throw in the towel  
Walk away with our pride  
Say it just wasn't worth  
All the tears that we cried  
  
But then again  
If we give it one more try  
We might find the feeling  
Never really died  
And there's still a chance to be  
All we might have been  
Let's find the love we had back then again  
  
Baby, if we want it bad enough  
We can make it better than it ever was  
  
And there's still a chance to be  
All we might have been  
Let's find the love we had back then again


The stakes are high  
We have to seize the chance  
A case of do or die  
This is our last dance  
  
A moment's hesitation and we always pay the price  
Hiding in the wings is just like walking on thin ice  
  
All our yesterdays will soon be ending  
Hide the walking shadow on the stage  
All our yesterdays be soon forgotten  
There's an easy way to turn the page  
  
The vision is too real  
The prize is there to take  
We're on an even keel  
No demons in our way  
  
If you stack the cards you will one day find your heaven  
Both sides of the dice are always adding up to seven  
  
All our yesterdays will soon be ending  
Hide the walking shadow on the stage  
All our yesterdays be soon forgotten  
There's an easy way to turn the page  
  
Yesterday's tomorrow is tomorrow's yesterday  
Find More lyrics at  
Destiny's forgotten, there's another game to play  
No more future perfect we just need the present tense  
All our yesterdays are only hanging in suspense  
  
Hang the banners high  
On the outward walls  
The battles lost and won  
That's when the hammer falls  
  
Racing to the future we must never lose our way  
All we have to do is take tomorrow's chance today  
  
All our yesterdays have come of age  
Now we all can sing a different song  
All our yesterdays have all departed  
The writing on the wall will soon be gone  
  
All our yesterdays (all our yesterdays)  
Now we all can sing a different song  
All our yesterdays (all our yesterdays)  
The writing on the wall will soon be gone  
  
All our yesterdays have come of age  
The writing on the wall will soon be gone

Well I sympathise completely but there's nothing I can do  
I am just a humble servant with a message here for you  
Well I know you have good reasons and there's things you've got to do  
But the boatman won't be waiting and he's leaving here with you  
And you can't take it with you  
No matter what you do  
No you can't take it with you  
Not the place you're going to  
  
(one more mile, one more road, one last bridge, one less load)  
  
Well I sympathise completely but there's nothing I can do  
I am just obeying orders, I'm a simple soul like you  
Well you really are persuasive, but I've heard it all before  
And the boatman's getting restless as he stands upon the shore  
And you can't take it with you  
No matter what you do  
No you can't take it with you  
Not the place you're going to  
Can't take it with you


The traveler is always leaving town  
He never has the time to turn around  
And if the road he's taken isn't leading anywhere  
He seems to be completely unaware  
  
The traveler is always leaving home  
The only kind of life he's ever known  
When every moment seems to be  
A race against the time  
There's always one more mountain left to climb  
  
Days are numbers, watch the stars  
We can only see so far  
Someday, you'll know where you are, remember  
  
Days are numbers, count the stars  
We can only go so far  
One day, you'll know where you are  
  
The traveler awaits the morning tide  
He doesn't know what's on the other side  
But something deep inside of him  
Keeps telling him to go  
He hasn't found a reason to say no  
  
The traveler is only passing through  
He cannot understand your point of view  
Abandoning reality, unsure of what he'll find  
The traveler in me is close behind  
  
Days are numbers, watch the stars  
We can only see so far  
Someday you'll know where you are  
  
Remember  
Days are numbers, count the stars  
We can only go so far  
One day, you'll know where you are  
  
Remember  
Days are numbers, watch the stars  
We can only see so far  
Someday you'll know where you are


If you believe in the power magic,  
I can change your mind  
And if you need to believe in someone,  
Turn and look behind  
When we were living in a dream world,  
Clouds got in the way  
We gave it up in a moment of madness  
And threw it all away  
  
Dont answer me, dont break the silence  
Dont let me win  
Dont answer me, stay on your island  
Dont let me in  
  
Run away and hide from everyone  
Can you change the things weve said and done?  
  
If you believe in the power of magic,  
Its all a fantasy  
So if you need to believe in someone,  
Just pretend its me  
It aint enough that we meet as strangers  
I cant set you free  
So will you turn your back forever on what you mean to me?  
  
Dont answer me, dont break the silence  
Dont let me win  
Dont answer me, stay on your island  
Dont let me in  
  
Run away and hide from everyone  
Can you change the things weve said and done?

This golden day will be mine  
For every moment in time  
If time should lose her way  
  
A symphony in the night  
Of stars that dance in the light  
And music far away  
  
They say that love is but a dance  
Don't let the music fade away  
Don't let the moment pass  
  
Without reason or rhyme  
The sweet bouquet of the wine  
Will vanish in the air  
  
The innocence of the rose  
She leaves where she goes  
For all the world to share  
  
Some days when clouds are drifting by  
I open my eyes and watch them go  
And wonder where they fly  
  
Some nights orion runs too fast  
I look to the stars as if to say  
Don't let the moment pass  
  
But soon a golden age is past  
Just when it seemed that miracles  
Where not too much to ask  
  
And though the world may turn too fast  
If it should seem like paradise  
Don't let the moment pass


[Verse:]  
Don't think  
Sorry's easily said  
Don't try  
Turning tables instead  
You've taken lots of chances before  
But I ain't gonna give anymore  
Don't ask me  
That's how it goes  
Cause part of me knows what you're thinking  
Don't say  
Words you're gonna regret  
Don't let  
Fire rush to your head  
I've heard the accusation before  
And I ain't gonna take anymore  
Believe me  
The sun in your eyes  
Made some of the lies worth believing  
  
[Chorus 1]  
I am the eye in the sky  
Looking at you  
I can read your mind  
I am the maker of rules  
Dealing with fools  
I can cheat you blind  
And I don't need to see anymore  
To know that  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Don't leave  
False illusions behind  
Don't cry  
I ain't changing my mind  
So find another fool like before  
Cause I ain't gonna live anymore believing  
Some of the lies while all of the signs are deceiving  
  
[Chorus 2:]  
I am the eye in the sky  
Looking at you  
I can read your mind  
I am the maker of rules  
Dealing with fools  
I can cheat you blind  
And I don't need to see anymore  
To know that  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind  
  
[Chorus 3 -Final]  
I am the eye in the sky  
Looking at you  
I can read your mind  
I am the maker of rules  
Dealing with fools  
I can cheat you blind  
And I don't need to see anymore  
To know that  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind (Looking At You),  
I can read your mind

What's the use of worrying  
If we'll be here tomarrow  
All we need to be is here today  
Don't care if you're rich  
Or if you have to beg and borrow  
You can always find a way  
Dive and breakaway  
  
Fall free  
Freedom's in the air  
It's calling you  
Your heart is there  
Fall free  
Blaze accross the sky  
The perfect fall  
The perfect high  
  
Mother earth looks peaceful  
As we climb towards the ceiling  
We must be ten thousand feet or more  
Hear the windrush screaming  
While we fight to curb our feelings  
As we stand beside the door  
Let our spirits soar  
  
Fall free  
Freedom's in the air  
It's calling you  
Your heart is there  
Fall free  
Blaze accross the sky  
The perfect fall  
The perfect high

Where do we go from here now that all other children are growin' up  
And how do we spend our lives if there's no-one to lend us a hand  
  
I don't want to live here no more,  
I don't want to stay  
Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life,  
Quietly fading away  
  
Games people play,  
You take take it or you leave it  
Things that they say,  
Are not right  
If I promise you the Moon and the Stars,  
Would you believe it  
Games people play in the middle of the night  
  
Where do we go from here now that all of the children have grown up  
And how do we spend our time knowin' nobody gives us a damn  
  
I don't want to live here no more,  
I don't want to stay  
Ain't gonna spend the rest of my life,  
Quietly fading away  
  
Games people play,  
You take take it or you leave it  
Things that they say,  
Just don't make it right  
If I'm tellin' you the truth right now,  
Do you believe it  
Games people play in the middle of the night  
  
Games people play,  
You take take it or you leave it  
Things that they say,  
Are not right  
If I promise you the Moon and the Stars,  
Would you believe it  
Games people play in the middle of the night  
  
Games people play,  
You take take it or you leave it  
Things that they say,  
Just don't make it right  
If I'm tellin' you the truth right now,  
Do you believe it

Watching waiting rising falling  
Listening calling drifting  
Touching feeling seeing believing  
Hoping sending leaving  
I couldn't say why you and I are gemini  
If I tried to write a million words a day  
I see your shadow coming closer  
Then watch you drifting away  
  
Watching Waiting rising falling  
Listening calling drifting  
Touching feeling seeing believing  
Hoping Sending leving  
I couldn't say why you and I are gemini  
We are travelling a million worlds away  
I see your Shadow coming closer  
Then watch you drifting away

You don't fool me with your tinted eyes and make-up  
The firebird hides in shadow when you wake up  
Your golden hair is black  
Your jeans are tight but your hide is slack  
Try it on the company but you don't fool me  
  
Well I'd rather be a man than play my role like you do  
I'd rather be a man than sin my soul like you do  
I'd rahter be a man than slave the way that you do  
I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do  
  
You don't fool me with your easy lies and fables  
You won't see me in ten buck furs and sables  
You sparkle like a snake  
The wine is real but the glass if fake  
Blame it on the apple tree but you don't fool me  
  
Well I'd rather be a man than play my role like you do  
I'd rather be a man than sin my soul like you do  
I'd rahter be a man than slave the way that you do  
I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do  
  
Your golden hair is black  
Your jeans are tight but your hide is slack  
Try it on the company but you don't fool me  
  
Well I'd rather be a man than play my role like you do  
I'd rather be a man than sin my soul like you do  
I'd rahter be a man than slave the way that you do  
I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do  
  
I'd rather be a man cause a man don't crawl like you do  
  
I'd rather be a man cause I wouldn't wanna be like you


Something's wrong in this house today  
While the master was riding the servants decided to play  
Something's wrong in this house today  
Something's been going on, there may be a price to pay  
There's evil brewing, getting out of control  
And I'm helpless, I can't put it right  
Something unrighteous is possessing my soul  
And it's cold in the heat of the night  
Something's wrong in this house today  
While the sorcerer slept the apprentice decided to play  
While the master was hiding the servants decided to play  
Might be too much sun or too much of something in the air  
Whatever's happening nobody else is aware  
There's evil brewing, getting out of control  
And I'm helpless, I can't put it right  
Something unrighteous is possessing my soul  
And it's cold in the heat of the night  
Something's wrong in this house today  
Something's been going on, there may be a price to pay  


Stealing a moment from Mr. Time  
He rocks in his chair like a shiny dime  
But it's all for show, all for show.  
Wearing your name and a number or two  
When the minute's up, so are you  
But everybody knows, everybody knows.  
Watching the hour from the light in his eyes,  
He waits for your soul to come in from the sky  
But it's lost below, lost below.  
Turning the Wheel of your destiny round,  
When the motion stops no more sound,  
Does anybody care, anybody care.  
Where's the man, where's the child  
Wrapped together side by side.  
Who can tell you what to do,  
When Mr. Time has come for you.  
See the truth, hear the lies,  
Can there be no compromise  
And who can tell you what they knew,  
When Mr. Time has come for you.  
Is it a feeling of deja vu?  
When he points his finger calling you  
Is it illusion? Just an illusion  
Picking up seconds that fall to his feet  
He blows them away as rocks on his seat,  
Cool as his smile, his smile.  
Where's the man, where's the child  
Wrapped together side by side.  
Who can tell you what to do,  
When Mr. Time has come for you  
See the truth, hear the lies,  
Can there be no compromise  
And who can tell you what they knew,  
When Mr. Time has come for you.


(bairnson)  
  
We say welcome to the mission  
Show us all what you can do  
We need a man with vision  
So we put our trust in you  
And now we hope sincerely  
That you'll do the best that you can do  
  
Oh for sure it won't be easy  
And we will have to risk our lives  
Some will try to break us  
And cut us down to size  
But jsut remember  
There can be no consolation prize  
Not in our eyes  
  
It's a long way to go  
We can't wait one more day  
We need someone to light up the way  
We may run out of time  
Can you hear what we say?  
Because heaven is so far away  
  
Although time is getting short  
There's still some sand left in the glass  
And now we have a living breathing  
Rocket man at last  
It's time to take a step  
And nail our colours to the mast  
  
No more talk of great adventures  
When it's movement that we need  
It must be our intention  
That we never loose the lead  
So count us down to zero  
And let's get up to speed  
We're up and away  
  
It's a long way to go  
We can't wait one more day  
We need someone to light up the way  
We may run out of time  
So believe what we say?  
Because heaven is so far away  
  
And so now they cry for justice  
As if justice will be done  
But the eye up in the sky  
Was flying to close to the sun  
The challenger has fallen  
And the race has now been run....

Maybe I'm imagining the things they say about me  
Maybe there is really nothing there at all  
Standing in the middle while the rumours fly around me  
Hiding from a shadow on an empty wall  
  
When my back is turned he's up to something else  
And I must not stop believing in myself  
Am I dreaming will the nightmare just go on  
And never end  
  
Somebody out there, says that he's you  
Somebody out there, talks like you do  
He calls up your number  
And you can't get through somebody out there  
  
Wish that I could run away and leave it all behind me  
Wish I wasn't hurt by all the things they say  
If I didn't need to know the simple truth about me  
Wouldn't it be easier to walk away  
  
And I don't need more confusion in my life  
No more pain and disillusion in my life  
If I'm dreaming will the nightmare just go on  
And never end  
  
Somebody out there, using your name  
Somebody out there, you get the blame  
There's doubt and suspicion  
It's hard to explain somebody out there  
  
And I don't need more confusion in my life  
No more pain and disillusion in my life  
If I'm dreaming will the nightmare just go on  
And never end  
  
Somebody out there, stolen your base  
Somebody out there, parked in your space  
You've no reservation, he's taken your place  
Somebody out there, wasting your time  
Somebody out there, using your dime  
Your friends think you're crazy  
They're way out of line  
Somebody out there, says that he's you  
Somebody out there, thinks like you do  
You stare at the mirror  
You're looking into  
Somebody out there

Ask yourself a question now there's a multiple choice  
"You've only one shot, get it right", says a distance voice  
Don't get your head into a spin  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
The enemy is closing in see the white of his eye  
He's taking in his prey in sight it's just a matter of time  
May the games begin the best man win  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
Is it the pride in you that wont let go  
Is it the fool that wont let it show  
  
Free yourself  
If only you could see yourself  
If you could see yourself  
  
And when the heavens opened up and the walls come tumbling down  
You know there is the only place to go  
And when you've had enough of fighting  
And every mean trick under the sun  
But still you fear the worst is yet to come  
Take the money and run  
  
Count the bottles one by one as they fall to the ground  
Search your mind your heart your soul until the answer is found  
But watch your step the ice is thin  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
The man in black looks down on you the insignificant one  
To be or not if all so true the deal is almost done  
It matters not you're lost to him  
If only you could see the mess you're in  
  
Is it the pride in you that wont let go  
Is it the fool that wont let it show?  
  
Free yourself  
If only you could see yourself  
If you could see yourself  
  
And when the heavens opened up and the walls come tumbling down  
You know it is the only place to go  
And when you've had enough of fighting  
And every mean trick under the sun  
But still you fear the worst is yet to come  
Take the money and run


By the last breath of the four winds that blow  
I'll have revenge upon Fortunato  
Smile in his face I'll say "come let us go  
I've a cask of Amontillado"  
  
Sheltered inside from the cold of the snow  
Follow me now to the vault down below  
Drinking the wine as we laugh at the time  
Which is passing incredibly slow  
  
(What are these chains that are binding my arm?)  
Part of you dies each passing day  
(Say it's a game and I'll come to no harm)  
You'll feel your life slipping away  
  
You who are rich and whose troubles are few  
May come around to see my point of view  
What price the Crown of a King on his throne  
When you're chained in the dark all alone  
  
(Spare me my life only name your reward)  
Part of you dies each brick I lay  
(Bring back some light in the name of the Lord)  
You'll feel your mind slipping away


And I could easily fall from grace  
Then another would take my place  
For the chance to behold your face  
  
As the days of my life are but grains of sand  
As they fall from your open hand  
At the call of the wind's command  
  
Many words are spoken when there's nothing to say  
The fall upon the ears of those who don't know the way  
To read between the lines, that lead between the lines, that lead me to you  
  
All that I ask you  
Is, show me how to follow you and I'll obey  
Teach me how to reach you I can't find my own way  
Let me see the light, let me be the light  
  
As the sun turns slowly around the sky  
Till the shadow of night is high  
The eagle will learn to fly  
  
As the days of his life are but grains of sand  
As they fall from your open hand  
And vanish upon the land  
  
Many words are spoken when there's nothing to say  
The fall upon the ears of those who don't know the way  
To read between the lines, that lead between the lines, that lead me to you  
Show me how to follow you and I'll obey  
Teach me how to reach you I can't find my own way  
Let me see the light, let me be the light  
And so, with no warning, no last goodbye  
In the dawn of the morning sky  
The eagle will rise again


[instrumental]  
  
(I) Prelude  
  
"Shadows of shadows passing. It is now 1831, and as always I am  
absorbed with a delicate thought. It is how poetry has indefinite  
sensations, to which end music is inessential. Since the comprehension  
of sweet sound is our most indefinite conception, music, when combined  
with a pleasurable idea, is poetry. Music without the idea is simply music.  
Without music or an intriguing idea, colour becomes pallor, man becomes  
carcase, home becomes catacomb, and the dead are but for a moment  
motionless."

The clock struck midnight  
And through my sleeping  
I heard a tapping at my door  
I looked but nothing lay in the darkness  
And so I turned inside once more  
To my amazement  
There stood a raven  
Whose shadow hung above my door  
Then through the silence  
It spoke that one word  
That I shall hear forever more  
Nevermore  
Thus quoth the raven, nevermore  
And still the raven remains in my room  
No matter how much I implore  
No words can soothe him  
No prayer remove him  
And I must hear for evermore  
Quoth the raven, nevermore  
Thus quoth the raven  
Nevermore

One more compromise I won't be making  
One more easy way out I won't be taking  
So many chances don't come twice  
So many eyes are made of ice  
One more cheating hand I won't be shaking  
  
One more substitute I won't be trying  
One more piece of the rock that I'm not buying  
So many times we stand and fight  
So many reasons can't be right  
One more simple truth I'm not denying  
  
Too many lonely hearts in the real world  
Too many lonely nights in the real world  
Too many fools who don't think twice  
Too many ways to pay the price  
Don't wanna live my life in the real world  
  
One more sacrifice I won't be making  
One more golden rule I won't be breaking  
No one to let me state my case  
No one to tell me to my face  
One more sweet suprise I won't be faking  
  
Too many lonely hearts in the real world  
Too many lonely nights in the real world  
Too many bridges you can burn  
Too many tables you can't turn  
Don't wanna live my life in the real world  
  
Too many lonely hearts in the real world  
Too many lonely nights in the real world  
Too many games that I can't play  
Too many windmills in my way  
Don't wanna live in the real world

Round your finger  
Token of the love we give one another  
Music of the future that we'll discover  
Promises to keep more than any other  
Symbolising all that we share  
  
The ring is magic  
The ring is power  
Like a candle in the dark for everyone to see  
The ring is madness  
The ring is fire  
And it burns with all the brightness of the sun  
  
In a circle  
Living in a world of perpetual motion  
Turning with the tide of a restless ocean  
Spinning on the wheel of your own emotion  
Ridin on a wild carrousel  
You'll be turning round and round  
Round and round we go  
  
Promises, promises, promises, promises  
  
Round your finger  
After all the years we've been together  
Walking in the sun and stormy weather  
Sharing in a moment to last forever  
Memories and dreams without end  
  
The ring is magic  
The ring is power  
And it finds you in the darkness of the night  
The ring is madness  
The ring is fire  
And it guides you when you're blinded by the light  
  
The ring is magic  
The ring is power  
Like a candle in the dark for all to see  
The ring is madness  
The ring is fire  
And it burns with all the brightness of the sun  
  
The ring is magic, magic, fire, fire  
The ring is mine


Tell me what to do  
Now the light in my life is gone from me  
Is it always the same  
Is the night never ending  
Tell me what to do  
All the hopes and the dreams went wrong for me  
There's a smile on my face  
But I'm only pretending  
Taking my life  
One day at a time  
Cause I can't think what else to do  
Taking some time  
To make up my mind  
When there's no one to ask but you  
The same old sun would shine in the morning  
The same bright eyes would welcome me home  
And the moon would rise way over my head  
And get through the night alone  
And the same old sun will shine in the morning  
The same bright stars will welcome me home  
And the clouds will rise way over my head  
I'll get through the night on my own  
Tell me what to do  
Now there's nobody watching over me  
If I seem to be calm  
Well it's all an illusion  
Tell me what to do  
When the fear of the night comes over me  
There's a smile on my face  
Just to hide the confusion  
Taking my life  
One day at a time  
Cause I can't think what else to do  
Taking some time  
To make up my mind  
When there's no one to ask but you  
The same old sun would shine in the morning  
The same bright eyes would welcome me home  
And the moon would rise way over my head  
And get through the night alone  
And the same old sun will shine in the morning  
The same bright stars will welcome me home  
And the clouds will rise way over my head  
I'll get through the night on my own  


Just what you need to make you feel better  
Just what you need to make you feel  
Just what you need to make you feel better  
Just what you need to make you feel  
  
At the far end of your tether  
And your thoughts won't fit together  
So you sleep light or whatever  
And the night goes on forever  
The your mind change like the weather  
Your in need of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether  
  
Even clouds seem bright and breezy  
'Cause the livin' is free and easy  
See the rat race in a new way  
Like you're walkin' up to a new day  
It's a wise thing if you're clever  
Take a lead from Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether  
  
Find the end of the rainbow  
Fly wherever the winds blow  
Laugh at life like a sideshow  
Just what you need to make you feel better  
  
Satisfaction altogether  
Guaranteed by Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether  
  
Find the end of the rainbow  
Fly wherever the winds blow  
Laugh at life like a slideshow  
Just what you need to make you feel better  
  
Don't stop bringin' the girls round  
Don't start havin' a showdown  
Keep on handin' the jug round  
All that you need is wine and good company


You should have seen him  
Lying alone in helpless silence in the night  
You should have seen him  
You would have seen his eye reflecting in the light  
  
So for the old man  
Ashes to ashes, earth to earth and dust to dust  
No one will see me  
No one with guilt to share, no secret soul to trust  
  
Louder and louder  
Till I could tell the sound was not within my ears  
You should have seen me  
You would have seen my eyes grow white and cold with fear  
  
Heard all the things in Heaven and Earth  
I've seen many things in Hell  
But his vulture's eye of a cold pale blue  
Is the eye of the Devil himself  
  
Take me away now  
But let the silence drown the beating of his heart


The Turn of a Friendly Card (Part 1)  
(Lead vocal - Chris Rainbow)  
There are unsmiling faces and bright plastic chains  
And a wheel in perpetual motion  
And they follow the races and pay out the gains  
With no show of outward emotion  
And they think it will make their lives easier  
For God knows up till now it's been hard  
But the game never ends when your whole world depends  
On the turn of a friendly card  
No the game never ends when your whole world depends  
On the turn of a friendly card  
There's a sign in the desert that lies to the west  
Where you can't tell the night from the sunrise  
And not all's the king's horse and all the king's men  
Have prevented the fall of the unwise  
For they think it will make their lives easier  
And God knows it's been hard  
But the game never ends when your whole world depends  
On the turn of a friendly card  
No the game never ends when your whole world depends  
On the turn of a friendly card  
But a pilgrim must follow in search of a shrine  
As he enters inside the cathedral...

It's almost a feeling you can touch in the air  
You look all around you, but nobody's there  
It's been a long time now since you've been aware  
That somebody's watching you  
  
He's gonna get you  
  
Sooner or later when your big chances come  
You'll look for the catches, but there'll be none  
Remember before you grab the money and run  
That someone is watching you  
  
He's gonna get you.  
  
Before you run and hide  
He's gonna get you  
You got no choice  
'Cause you can't escape the voice  
  
Jumping with shadows that come up from behind  
You're scared of the darkness that's there in your mind  
You're frightened to move because of what you might find  
Someone is watching you  
  
He's gonna get you.  
  
Before you run and hide  
He's gonna get you  
You got no choice  
'Cause you can't escape the voice


An anthem to the human condition  
  
Lead vocal: john miles  
  
What kind of madness rule the world today  
What earthly reason holding sway  
There is no heaven at all  
For some may weep  
And some may sleep  
While some may rise  
And some may fall  
  
No one is an island  
No one born alone  
No man can turn the tide of fortune on his own  
Though some may dare to try  
  
Say there but for the grace of God go you my friend  
Say there but for the grace of God go I  
Go I  
  
And so we live in lives of fantasy  
And dream of dreams that hold the key  
And we follow like sheep  
We thread the path  
That leads to thee  
We seek the soul that is not ours to keep  
  
No one is an island  
No one born alone  
No man can turn the tide of fortune on his own  
Though some may dare to try  
  
Say there but for the grace of God go you my friend  
Say there but for the grace of God go I  
Go i


Time, flowing like a river  
Time, beckoning me  
Who knows when we shall meet again  
If ever  
But time  
Keeps flowing like a river  
To the sea  
  
Goodbye my love,  
Maybe for forever  
Goodbye my love,  
The tide waits for me  
Who knows when we shall meet again  
If ever  
But time  
Keeps flowing like a river (on and on)  
To the sea, to the sea  
  
Till it's gone forever  
Gone forever  
Gone forevermore  
  
Goodbye my friends,  
Maybe forever  
Goodbye my friends,  
The stars wait for me  
Who knows where we shall meet again  
If ever  
But time  
Keeps flowing like a river (on and on)  
To the sea, to the sea  
  
Till it's gone forever  
Gone forever  
Gone forevermore

Lyrics by Alan Parsons  
  
You drink the wine  
You play the fool  
You cross the line  
You lose your cool  
But no one cares  
Still no one cares  
  
You raise the bar  
Lost in a trance  
One bridge too far  
No second chance  
But no one cares  
Still no one cares  
  
We play the game  
We hold our own  
We fight to win  
We stand alone  
  
You had a dream  
You cast the dice  
Your shady scheme  
You paid the price  
But no one cares  
Still no one cares  
  
We play the game  
With hearts of stone  
You lose again  
You're on your own  
  
A turning tide  
A streak of light  
Arms open wide  
The end's in sight  
And someone cares  
Yes someone cares  
  
We play the game  
We hold our own  
We fight to win  
We stand alone


Make me a channel of your peace,  
Where there is hatred, let me bring Your love,  
Where there is injury, Your pardon Lord,  
And where there's doubt, true faith in You  
  
Oh Master, grant that I may never seek,  
So much to be consoled as to console,  
To be understood, as to understand,  
To be loved, as to love with all my soul  
  
Make me a channel of your peace,  
Where there's despair in life let me bring hope,  
Where there is darkness, let me bring light,  
And where there's sadness, bring Your joy  
  
Oh Master, grant that I may never seek,  
So much to be consoled as to console,  
To be understood, as to understand,  
  
To be loved, as to love with all my soul  
  
Make me a channel of your peace,  
Where there's despair in life let me bring hope,  
Where there is darkness, let me bring Your light,  
And where there's sadness, bring Your joy  
  
Oh Master, grant that I may never seek,  
So much to be consoled as to console,  
To be understood, as to understand,  
To be loved, as to love with all my soul  
  
Make me a channel of your peace,  
For when we give, we will ourselves receive  
It is in pardoning that we are pardoned  
And in dying that we gain eternal life  
And in dying that we gain eternal life


We're walking in the air  
We're floating in the moonlit sky  
The people far below are sleeping as we fly  
  
I'm holding very tight  
I'm riding in the midnight blue  
I'm finding I can fly so high above with you  
  
Far across the world  
The villages go by like dreams  
The rivers and the hills, the forests and the streams  
  
Children gaze open mouthed  
Taken by surprise  
Nobody down below believes their eyes  
  
We're surfing in the air  
We're swimming in the frozen sky  
We're drifting over icy mountains floating by  
  
Suddenly swooping low  
On an ocean deep  
Rousing up a mighty monster from his sleep  
  
And walking in the air  
We're dancing in the midnight sky  
And everyone who sees us greets us as we fly  
  
We're walking in the air  
We're walking in the air


But over in a land that's in my back yard  
There's a people who succeed, they don't try hard  
  
Well, they found a way to live with ease  
By eating from the bush instead of the trees  
  
Apple bush, apple tree  
Path to eternity  
Find you a path and you follow the call  
  
Apple bush, apple tree  
Back to eternity  
Cut you a path with a chance you may fall  
  
Well, over in a corner, standing there  
Telling my house that they haven't a single care  
  
But my house does not listen (worry) it's got a path of it's own  
Yet the bush, and a tree, never leave it alone  
  
Apple Bush, apple tree  
Back to eternity  
Find you a path and you buy with a call  
  
Apple bush, apple tree  
Back to eternity  
Cut you a path with a chance you may fall  
  
Someday like my house you're going to chose too  
If you cut this new path well the old one will do  
and you live with the people who live with ease  
The red apple bush, the blue apple tree


Mommy where's daddy?  
He's been gone for so long.  
Do you think he'll ever come home?  
  
I was gone for fourteen days  
I coulda been gone for more  
Held up in the intensive care ward  
Lyin' on the floor  
I was gone for all those days  
But I, was not all alone  
I made friends with a lot of people  
In the danger zone  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
I see it every day  
See my lonely mind explode  
Since I've gone away  
  
I think I lost some weight there  
And I, I'm sure I need some rest  
Sleepin don't come very easy  
In a straight white vest  
Should like to see that little children  
She's only four years old.. old  
I'd give her back all of her play things  
Even, even the ones I stole  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
I see it everyday  
See my lonely mind explode  
When I've gone insane  
  
I want to get out of here  
I want to get out of here  
I, I've gotta, I've gotta get out of here  
I, I gotta get out of here  
I, I gotta get out of here  
IgottagetoutahereIgottagetoutahereIgottagetoutahere  
Ya gotta let me out of here  
Let me outta her  
Etc  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
I see it everyday  
See my lonely mind explode  
Blown up in my face  
  
I grabbed my hat and I got my coat  
And I, I ran into the street  
I saw a man that was choking there  
I guess he couldn't breathe  
Said to myself this is very strange  
I'm glad it wasn't me  
But now I hear those sirens callin'  
And so I am not free  
I didn't want to be  
I didn't want to be  
I didn't want to be  
  
See my lonely life unfold  
(I didn't want to be)  
I see it every day  
(Leave me alone  
I didn't want to be  
Don't touch me!)  
See my lonely mind explode  
When I've gone Insane


She struts into the room  
Well I don't know her  
But with a magnifying glance  
I just sorta look her over  
  
We have a drink or two, well maybe three  
And then suddenly, she starts telling me her life story  
  
She says  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby, if you want to, be my lover  
You better take me home  
Cause it's a long long way to paradise  
And I'm still on my own.  
  
Told her that I came from Detroit City  
And I played guitar in a long haired rock and roll band  
She asked me why the singer's name was Alice  
I said 'listen baby, you really wouldn't understand'  
  
And I said  
  
[Chorus]  
  
On my own,  
  
Oh, baby, if you want to, be my lover  
You better take me home,  
Cause it's a long, long way, to paradise,  
And I'm still on my own, own


I wish I could tell you something you didn't know  
I wish I could give you something you didn't owe  
I wish I could tell you a joke to make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some nameless fascination that showed up at your door  
And when you're sad and blue my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
  
I just want to take you somewhere you haven't been  
Find an old time movie where we don't know the end  
Lost in the radio, drive another mile  
So I could be with you awhile  
  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some nameless fascination that showed up at your door  
And when you're sad and blue my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
  
Tired of serious conversation  
Tangled up in situations  
I feel so free 'cause you want nothing from me  
  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some hopeless vagabond asleep there on your floor  
And when you're old and gray my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
Just want to be that someone you weren't looking for  
Some nameless fascination that showed up at your door  
And when you're old and gray my jokes still make you smile  
And I could be with you awhile  
I just want to be with you awhile  
I just want to be with you awhile  
I just want to be with you....


Hey Hey  
Hey Hey  
I guess I'm a loner and I don't fit in (No...)  
I ain't too comfortable in my skin (oh...)  
An' I don't play well with the others  
  
I'm stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
I can't decide between my rules and your rules  
  
Hey Hey  
Hey Hey  
Nobody wants me hanging round  
Unless it's from a tree in the middle of town  
And I'm out of step with the others  
  
I'm stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
I can't decide between my rules and your rules  
I'm stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
So I defy maybe all rules maybe no rules  
  
My clothes don't make me  
My hair ain't cut right  
And I don't care much  
No I don't care at all  
  
I guess my brain is out of synch, I think  
  
  
I'm stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
I can't decide between my rules and your rules  
I'm stuck somewhere between high school and old school  
I can't decide, I just can't decide  
  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
Aw...


I'm lazy, you know it  
I'm ready for the second show  
Amazin', thing growing  
Just waitin' for the juice to flow  
  
But you're so very picturesque  
You're so very cold  
Tastes like roses on your breath  
But graveyards on your soul  
  
I'm hurting, I'm wanting  
I'm aching for another go  
You're squirming wet, baby  
Nothin' bad comin' very slow  
And it's burnin' holes in me  
  
You're so very picturesque  
You're so very cold  
It tastes like roses on your breath  
But graveyards on your soul... whoa-oh  
  
One spastic explosion  
Two pressure-cookers go insane  
It makes me act crazy  
I shiver but I love this game  
  
You're so very ordinary  
You're so very lame  
Tastes like whiskey on your lips  
And earthworms rule your brain


I'm changing, arranging  
Things I never thought I'd move before  
I'm changing, arranging  
To your personality I asked for it before  
I need a soul who'll never say what I feel  
Just fearing that I will accept the ideal  
I look up high and I swear all I see  
It's a carbon copy image of me  
I'm dying hard trying  
Baby, baby, for the rest of my life  
I'm trying hard dying  
Maybe, maybe he's trying to be my life  
I've got a never ending battle inside  
Just trying to rectify my personal pride  
I swear I don't know what it's got over me  
But I know it doesn't want to be free


I'm a clone  
I know it and I'm fine  
I'm one and more are on the way  
I'm two, doctor  
Three's on the line  
He'll take incubation another day  
CHORUS: I'm all alone, so are we all  
We're all clones  
All are one and one are all  
All are one and one are all  
We destroyed the government  
We're destroying time  
No more problems on the way  
  
REFRAIN: I'm through doctor  
We don't need your kind  
The other ones  
Ugly ones  
Stupid boys  
Wrong ones  
CHORUS  
Six is having problems  
Adjusting to his clone status  
Have to put him on a shelf  
(Please don't put me on the shelf)  
All day long we hear him crying so loud  
I just want to be myself  
I just want to be myself  
I just want to be myself  
Be myself  
Be myself  
  
I'm all alone, so are we all  
We destroyed the government  
We're destroyed time  
No more problems on the way  
REFRAIN  
CHORUS  
I'm all alone, so are we all  
We're all clones  
All are one and one are all  
All are one and one are all  
  
  
  


Your dress is hangin' on a hook on the door  
My jeans are lying in a pile on the floor, yeah  
Flat on my back, tryin' to catch my breath  
When we were rockin' tonight  
I thought that we were gonna rock to death  
  
But what's that in your eyes?  
I'm no longer paralyzed  
Here we go again  
  
Crawlin', you come crawling to me  
I go crawling to you  
We come crawling  
You come crawling to me  
I go crawling to you  
  
Your hair is tangled and your lipstick is gone  
You're stretched out, calling my name  
With just your high heels on  
We hunt each other on our hands and our knees  
Well I'm an alley cat  
And you're a hot little Siamese  
  
But what's that in your eyes?  
I'm no longer paralyzed  
Here we go again  
  
Crawlin', you come crawling to me  
I go crawling to you  
We come crawling  
You come crawling to me  
I go crawling to you


I'm gonna sign my name to full confession  
It seems the woman I loved last night  
Belongs to another man  
  
They'd like to take you home  
They'd like to purr and tease you  
But I'm a passionate man  
And I couldn't leave her alone  
  
'Cause you are damned if you do  
Damned if you don't  
Damned if you will  
Damned if you won't  
  
Sometimes they look so good  
But don't you let 'em deceive you  
'Cause then you find out that they got  
Some kind of a venomous mind  
  
And the thing that's worse  
Is that it all seems worth it  
I'm still a passionate man  
And she wouldn't leave me alone  
  
If you think that being a stud is easy  
Well, now don't ask me, boys  
I wouldn't know, I'm a little slow  
  
And you are damned if you do  
And damned if you don't  
You're damned if you will  
And you are damned if you won't  
  
If you think that being a stud is easy  
Well, now don't ask me, boys  
I wouldn't know, I'm a little slow  
  
Gonna sign my name to full confession  
It seems the woman I loved last night  
Belongs to another man  
  
They'd like to take you home  
They'd like to purr and tease you  
And I'm a passionate man  
And I couldn't leave her alone  
  
'Cause you are damned if you do  
Damned if you don't  
Damned if you will  
Damned if you won't  
  
Damned if you do  
Damned if you don't  
Damned if you will  
And damned if you won't, ooh  
  
I'll be damned


Little Betty ate a pound of aspirin  
She got them from the shelf up on the wall  
Betty's mommy wasn't there to save her  
She didn't hear her little baby call  
Wah!  
  
Dead babies  
Can't take care of themselves  
Dead babies  
Can't take things off the shelf  
Well we didn't want you anyway  
Lalala-la, lalala-la, la la la  
  
Daddy is an agrophile in Texas  
Mommy's on the bar most every night  
Little Betty's sleeping in the graveyard  
Living there in burgundy and white  
  
Dead babies  
Can't take care of themselves  
Dead babies  
Can't take things off the shelf  
Well we didn't love you anyway  
Lalala-la, lalala-la, la la la  
  
Goodbye Little Betty  
Goodbye Little Betty  
So long Little Betty  
So long Little Betty  
Betty, so long  
  
Dead babies  
Can't take care of themselves  
Dead babies  
Can't take things off the shelf  
Well we didn't need you anyway  
Lalala-la, lalala-la, la la la  
  
Goodbye, Little Betty  
  
Order in the court! Order in the court room!  
Order! Order in the court! Order!


We're in trouble all the time  
You read about us all in the papers  
We walk around and bump into walls - a blind delegation  
And we ain't afraid of high power  
We're bullet proof  
And we've never heard of Eisenhower  
Missile power, justice or truth  
  
We're the Department of Youth  
Your new Department of Youth  
We're the Department of Youth  
Just me and youth  
  
We talk about this whole stupid world  
And still come out laughing  
We never make any sense  
But hell that never mattered  
But we'll make it through our blackest hour  
We're living proof  
And we've never heard of Billy Sunday  
Damon Runyon, manners or couth  
We're the Department of Youth  
Your new Department of Youth  
We're the Department of Youth  
Just me and youth  
  
We're the Department of Youth  
The new Department of Youth  
We're the Department of Youth  
We've got the power  
We're the Department of Youth  
And who gave it to you?  
Donny Osmond!  
What?!


I'm a gambler  
And I'm a runner  
But you knew that  
When you lay down  
  
I'm a picture  
Of ugly stories  
I'm a killer  
And I'm a clown  
  
Step into the street by sundown  
Step into your last goodbye  
You're a target just by living  
Twenty dollars will make you die  
  
I wear lace  
And I wear black leather  
My hands are lightning up  
On my gun  
  
My shots are clean  
And my, my shots are final  
My shots are deadly  
And when it's done  
  
You're as stiff as my smoking barrel  
You're as dead as a desert night  
You're a notch  
And I'm a legend  
You're at peace  
And I must hide  
  
Tell where the hell I'm going  
Let my bones fall in the dust  
Can't you hear that ghost that's calling  
As my Colt begins to rust  
In the dust  
  
I'm a killer  
I'm a clown  
I'm a priest  
That's gone to town


Get ready for the lady  
She's gonna be a treat  
Simmer slightly 'til ready  
Make her soft too  
Make her sweet  
  
I kiss the tears off from your chest  
I felt the poison fright that's in your breath  
I knew your precious life and I know your death  
I squeeze the love out of your soul  
All the perfect love that's in your soul  
You're just another spirit on parole  
  
Devil's food  
Devil's food  
Devil's food


Pardon me,  
But you see,  
I've seen that face before  
I know those eyes  
Unearthly wise  
I feel it more and more  
To look at you,  
Deja vu,  
Chills me to the core  
  
They say that you are the king  
Of this whole damn thing  
But that only confused me  
Said I don't stand a ghost  
Of a chance with my host  
And that frankly amused me  
So let's drink a few  
Here's lookin' at you, I swear  
Didn't we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere?  
Didn't we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere?  
  
Gradually  
I can see  
Things are getting clear  
That ageless face  
Satanic grace  
This sudden rush of fear  
  
They say that you are the king  
Of this whole damn thing  
Now they got me believin'  
Said I don't stand a ghost  
Of a chance with my host  
So I'd better be leavin'  
So let's drink a few  
Here's lookin' at you, I swear  
Didn't we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere?  
  
Here I am  
Door's been slammed  
They're gonna roast my hide  
Make me bleed  
'Til I plead  
For you to let me die  
  
They say that you are the king  
Of this whole damn thing  
Now they got me believin'  
Said I don't stand a ghost  
Of a chance with my host  
God, I wish I'd believed them  
So let's drink a few  
Here's lookin' at you, I swear  
Didn't we meet in the night in my sleep somewhere?  
Didn't we meet  
In the night in my sleep?  
Didn't we meet  
In the night in my sleep  
Somewhere?


A hundred numbers on my wall  
Some with names I sometimes call  
I drop a coin and watch it fall  
Tryin' to get connected to you  
  
A thousand hours all alone  
My softest pillow turns hard as stone  
This is the longest night on my own  
Lying here thinking of you  
  
Sometimes I shake my head  
And laugh to myself  
I'd like start again with somebody else  
I'm like a broken toy forgotten on the shelf  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby, I could have been someone  
I could have been something  
It would have been nothing to die for you  
Baby, you're going to need me  
You'd better believe me  
It would have been easy to die for you  
  
A milloin memories flood my brain  
Drown my sorrow  
Kill my pain  
Wets my thirst for you again  
Just another night to get through  
  
All my neighbors scream for quite at my door  
Shattered glass and torn up photos thrown on the floor  
Well, I couldn't stand to see your pictures anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
These cuts are deep but you plead innocent  
Are you hell or are you heaven-sent?  
You're much too cold to know how much  
You meant to me, yeah  
  
A billion tear drops fallen from my eyes  
But it's just a joke now  
And I'm laughing at your lies  
You made me hard as rock and now I realize  
  
[Chorus]


It looked so good, your perfect plan  
You had to get greedy to be the man  
Now you're holding the bag, paying the price  
Gonna get burned by the heat of the ice  
  
Dirty diamonds  
  
You rolled the dice, you bet your life  
You put your trust in your trophy wife  
Got stabbed in the back in the blink of an eye  
She's in bed with the boys and the FBI  
  
Dirty Diamonds  
Blood soaked money in your shakin' fist  
Dirty diamonds  
Stone cold killers and you're on their list  
Ah, ah oh yeah  
  
You're tied to a chair witha gun at your head  
Your face is all smeared with the blood that's been shed  
You were gonna be rich  
Now you're gonna be dead  
And all that glitters turns to lead  
  
Dirty Diamonds  
Blood soaked money in your shakin' fist  
Dirty diamonds  
Stone cold killers and you're on their list  
  
Dirty Diamonds  
Blood soaked money in your shakin' fist  
Dirty diamonds  
Stone cold killers and you're on their list  
  
Dirty Diamonds  
  
Diamonds don't cheat  
Diamonds don't lie  
Diamonds are forever  
Diamonds never die  
  
Dirty Diamonds  
Blood soaked money in your shakin' fist  
Dirty diamonds  
Stone cold killers and you're on their list  
  
Dirty Diamonds  
Blood soaked money in your shakin' fist  
Dirty diamonds  
Stone cold killers and you're on their list  
  
Run for your life, you can't hide  
Can't you hear 'em coming  
You're gonna die  
You better run for your life, you can't hide  
Can't you hear 'em coming  
You're gonna die  
You better run for your life, you can't hide  
Can't you hear 'em coming  
You're gonna die  
You better run for your life, you can't hide  
Can't you hear 'em coming  
You're gonna die


I want to tell you a story, happened long ago  
About a redneck boy down from Tupelo  
I got the slick black hair, I played a rock guitar  
I liked to shake my hips, man, then i went too far  
  
He ate his weight in country ham  
Killed on pills and woke in Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
  
I had a lot of girls, yeah, I had a lot of guns  
When they found me dead, ow, the whole world was stunned  
Went to the pearly gates, said, "I'm the hippest thing"  
And Peter said "Well son, we already got ourselves a king"  
  
He lived on southern deep-fried spam,  
Killed on pills and woke in Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
  
He finished his short life sweaty and bloated and stoned  
(A-Hey-Hey)  
He ruled his domain and he died on the throne  
No "Yes-Men", no colonel, he went all alone...  
  
(Hey, man, that looks like me down there on the floor)  
  
I heard the devil cry real loud and clear  
"You were the big man, there, hejust a sideman here  
Well, I know your face, and I've heard your name  
Looks like heaven's loss, gonna be my gain"  
(I've got plans for you, man)  
  
He ate his weight in country ham  
Killed on pills and woke in Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
Disgraceland  
  
Well, I woke up, right here in Disgraceland  
Disgraceland, thank you, thank you very much

To redesign his streamline face  
Now strong and sleek but still no taste  
Guilty

Won't go to Hungary  
Iran is out  
Welcome to Moscow, huh

A tree has grown on the spot  
Where her body did rest  
Blood seeped in the soil  
From the knife in her chest  
  
The bugs serve time in her skeletal jail  
I wonder how the bugs remember Gail  
  
Oh, what a lovely young girl  
Everybody would say  
You can still hear her laugh  
In the shadows on a cold winter day  
  
A dog dug up a bone and wagged his tail  
I wonder how the dog.. remembers Gail  
  
The bugs serve time in her skeletal jail  
I wonder how that I'll remember Gail

Do a show  
Save a child  
Raise a million bucks  
That'll last a while  
Fight at parties  
Buy a horse  
Lose a couple  
Win that big divorce  
  
I want to be in the headlines  
Anything to be in the headlines  
  
Saw my chance  
Made my break  
Took the biggest float  
In the Rose parade  
Got jailed  
No disgrace  
A hundred million people  
Saw my face  
  
Called a conference  
With the press  
Announced my marriage plans  
In a wedding dress  
Climb a building  
At six-below  
On New Year's Eve  
Without a stitch of clothes  
  
I want to be in the headlines  
Anything to be in the headlines  
As long as they spell my name right  
I hope that they catch my best side  
  
Popped out  
From a cake  
At the President's ball  
What a big mistake  
Fifty guns  
Aimed at me  
I was nearly killed  
But what publicity  
Nominated  
Something big  
Stole the hottest scene  
Says the Globe And Trib  
Porno movie  
Comes to light  
But I was starving then  
So that's alright  
  
I want to be in the headlines  
Anything to be in the headlines  
  
As long as the spell my name right  
Hope that they catch my best side  
Keep my sidewalk status star bright  
Feel free to walk on me tonight  
Just don't spit on me  
  
Headlines, headlines  
Headlines, headlines

You're with your baby  
And you're parked alone  
On a summer night  
You're deep in love  
But you're deeper in the woods  
You think you're doin' alright  
  
You heard a voice  
Did you see that face  
Or was it just a dream  
It can't be real  
That only happens, babe  
On the movie screen  
  
If you see him comin'  
Get away if you can  
He's a dangerous man  
Throws a dangerous party man  
  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
And he's out of control  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
He crawled out of his hole  
Just to rock and roll  
  
He's going out tonight  
Going to make his rounds to get his fill  
Standing staight and tall  
He's a ton of fun  
And he's dressed to kill  
  
You know you read he was gone  
It surely is him  
But he's back on the prowl  
Again and again and again  
  
Don't you know  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
And he's out of control  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
He crawled out of his hole  
Just to rock and roll  
  
You know you read he was gone  
It surely is him  
But he's back on the prowl  
Again and again and again  
  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
And he's out of control  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
He crawled out of his hole  
Just to rock and roll  
  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
And he's out of control  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
He crawled out of his hole  
Just to rock and roll  
  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
And he's out of control  
He's back  
The man behind the mask  
He crawled out of his hole  
Just to rock and roll  
  
He's back

I'm in control, I got a bulletproof soul  
And I'm full of self-esteem  
I invented myself with no one's help  
I'm a prototype supreme  
I sit on my private throne  
And run my lifestyle all alone  
Me, myself and I agree  
We don't need nobobdy else  
  
I never learned to bow, bend or crawl  
To any known authority  
I really want to build my statue tall  
That's all  
  
I'm just trying to be God  
I only want to be God  
I just want to be God  
Why can't I be God  
  
I got no time to take advice  
I want to gamble with my eternity with loaded dice  
I don't need a preacher in my face  
When I'm the omnipresent ruler of the human race  
Ain't gonna spend my life being no one's fool  
I was born to rock and I was born to rule  
But if I'm wrong on judgement day  
I'm royally screwed with hell to pay  
  
I never learned to bow, bend or crawl  
To any known authority  
I really want to build my statue tall  
That's all  
  
I'm just trying to be God  
I only want to be God  
I just want to be God  
Why can't I be God  
I'm just trying to be God  
I only want to be God  
I just want to be God  
Why can't I be God  
  
I'm just trying to be God  
I only want to be God  
I just want to be God  
Why can't I be God  
I'm just trying to be God  
I only want to be God  
I just want to be God  
Why can't I be God


I bought a Porsche  
And I'm leavin Grand Rapids  
Quit my job, quit my school  
Quit this place  
My mother cried  
My father was fried  
Hey, I've got no time, man  
I want to say goodbye to my babes  
I like girls  
  
I dumped on Sheila on Thursday  
I'll drop Melissa today  
I'll kiss some tears off of Donna  
Ask if she'll call on Shauna  
Amanda, and Sandra and Kay  
I like girls, I love 'em to death  
  
Hey Valentino! You going somewhere?  
You wouldn't sneak out on me, would you?  
What's that a blond hair?  
He must visualize himself an Errol Flynn  
  
I see myself a suave sophisticated lover  
I'll meet a rich hot old Hollywood dame  
You see, my ultimate goal  
Will be my life bein' told  
In a penthouse letter that I can frame  
And keep it all my life  
Girls, I love 'em, oh yeah  
  
New luggage? Did you say you were going  
Somewhere? Oh, just out for some fresh air  
Does she have a nice pair?  
  
He was swallowed alive by the freeway  
Turned into an ant on parade  
He bravely drove off that beast  
Aimed his car back to the east  
Why be a snack at home?  
I'm a feast, for the girls  
I like girls, I really like 'em  
  
Well,well,well.Look who's back. Run out of gas?  
Patty, I was just gonna call you. Look...  
I left Donna and Shauna  
And Katy and Carrie  
Melissa and Dena  
I just didn't have any use for 'em  
I just want you  
Really, no really, honest!

Touched by thoughts  
As cold as ice  
Like some bathroom floor  
No love can be worth this price  
Still I ask for more  
  
Endless days and restless nights  
And forgotten scenes  
Hopelessly I tried to find  
Escape from this deam  
  
Baby I miss you  
When are you coming home  
No matter where you are  
I hate being alone  
  
Love is sweet  
And bitter too  
The taste can leave cold  
You know I hate it  
But I cannot refuse to capture control  
  
How it seems  
There's no way out  
I guess I never knew  
Emptiness has left no doubt  
Now I want you  
  
Baby I miss you  
When are you coming home  
No matter where you are  
I hate being alone  
  
Baby I miss you  
When are you coming home  
No matter where you are  
I hate being alone  
  
Baby I miss you  
When are you coming home  
You've been gone for so long  
Baby I miss you  
When are you coming home  
Tell me you're coming back


My tape recorder,  
It must be lyin'  
'Cause this I just can't believe.  
I hear a voice that's cryin',  
That's not me.  
  
The wheel goes round.  
I hear a sound.  
It's comin' out all wrong.  
And I swear to you I never wrote that song.  
  
I been livin' in my own shell so long:  
The only place I ever feel at home.  
  
And oh, that music,  
I hate those lyrics.  
It stayed inside me so long.  
And I swear to you I never wrote that song.  
  
But pardon me,  
I'm not lookin' for sympathy,  
Not sympathy.  
I'm just thinking out loud.  
The melody,  
It goes nowhere pointlessly.  
Silence please.  
  
I been livin' in my own shell so long:  
The only place I ever feel at home.  
  
And oh, that music,  
I hate those lyrics.  
It stayed inside me so long.  
And I swear to you I never.


I was just kicking down the street  
And the sun was in my eyes  
So I couldn't see the truck  
That was sixty times my size  
And just seconds off from splattering me  
Let me tell you  
I was so scared I couldn't move  
Like my boots were full of glue  
Then I felt a little tug  
And I thought of good Old Blue  
And he pulled me from that catastrophe  
  
That was the day  
My dead pet returned to save my life  
I'm alive  
He's alive  
I'm alive  
  
I was spitting in the canyon  
Near the cliff up on the mountain  
When an unexpected sneeze  
Hung me in the breeze  
At forty five degrees in the sky  
Suddenly I felt something  
Had me by the belt  
And in between my praying  
Swore I heard a stallion neighing  
Was the ghost of my horse  
And I cried, yes I cried  
  
That was the day  
My dead pet returned to save my life  
That was the day  
My dead pet returned to save my life  
I'm alive  
He's alive  
Hey, I'm alive  
  
Things were getting gory  
Got caught on territory  
Belonging to the Crutches  
In an alley in their clutches  
Looking kind of dismal that night  
Well the leader's name was Fats  
Swinging broken baseball bats  
Things got really frantic  
Starting jumping in their panic  
Hallucinating billions of rats  
Lots of rats  
  
That was the day  
My dead pet returned to save my life  
That was the day  
My dead pet returned to save my life  
I'm alive, I'm alive, real alive  
  
That was the day my dead pet returned  
That was the day my dead pet returned  
That was the day my dead pet returned  
That was the day my dead pet returned  
To save my life  
  
I'm alive, I'm alive  
He's alive, he's alive, he's alive  
I'm alive, yeah  
He's alive, he's alive  
I'm alive, real alive  
Alive, alive, alive  
Alive, alive, alive, alive  
Alive, alive, alive, alive  
I'm alive


I never kicked a dog, a child or my wife  
I never looked at pornography  
I swear it on my holy saint mother's life  
But somehow she's down here with me  
  
The road to hell is littered with nice guys with good intentions  
But once you're there, you're there, it's much too late  
I can cry and scream it's just not fair  
To leave me here like you don't care  
There must be some mistake up there in heaven  
  
Now it's much too late  
My time has passed away  
All my plans and dreams have all ended  
Now it's much too late  
To try and plead my case  
And I don't know the God I've offended  
It's too late  
  
I never stole a thing, a toy or a kiss  
My conscience is a clear as can be  
And when I was a teen, all the sex that I missed  
Was an abstinence blessing to me  
  
The road to hell is littered with nice guys with good intentions  
But once you're there, you're there, it's much too late  
I can cry and scream it's just not fair  
To leave me here like you don't care  
There must be some mistake up there in heaven  
  
Now it's much too late  
My time has passed away  
All my plans and dreams have all ended  
Now it's much too late  
To try and plead my case  
And I don't know the God I've offended  
It's too late  
  
Now it's much too late  
My time has passed away  
All my plans and dreams have all ended  
Now it's much too late  
To try and plead my case  
And I don't know the God I've offended  
It's too late  
It's much too late  
My time has passed away  
All my plans and dreams have all ended  
Now it's much too late  
To try and plead my case  
And I don't know the God I've offended  
It's too late  
It's much to late


What did I do to deserve such a fate  
I didn't really want to get  
Involved in this thing  
Someone handed me this gun and I  
I gave it everything  
Yeah, I gave it everything  
  
I came into this life  
Looked all around  
I saw just what I liked  
And took what I found  
Nothing came easy  
Nothing came free  
Nothing came all until they  
Came after me  
  
Yeah-hey, yeah  
  
I didn't really want to get  
Involved in this thing  
Someone handed me this gun and I  
I gave it everything  
Yeah, I gave it everything


I find myself running in circles  
Lost and half insane  
And I need a cure sometimes  
To knock out the pain  
  
So I yell out for some kind of angel  
To come down and rescue me  
Be as soft as you can  
Put a drink in my hand  
I'm as scared as I ever could be  
  
Gimme lace and whiskey  
Mamas home remedy  
Double indemnity  
Fills me with ecstasy  
La-aa-aace and whiskey  
  
Lots of things I really want here  
Lots of things I really need  
There's an animal soul inside  
That I've gotta feed  
My hot mamas feminine body (?)  
Always gets a rise from me  
She's so soft in my hands  
I give her all she can stand  
Make a full fledged man outta me  
  
Gimme lace and whiskey  
Mamas home remedy  
Double indemnity  
Fills me with ecstasy  
La-aa-ace and whiskey  
La-aa-ace and whiskey  
  
I ain't hard ass'd  
So babe don't make me mean  
I want a hot place  
To go and show you things  
  
Gimme lace and whiskey  
Mamas home remedy  
Double indemnity  
Fills me with ecstasy  
La-aa-ace and whiskey  
  
I'll end up a broken old hobo  
With red and yellow eyes  
Swear' and drunk and dyin'  
But no ones surprised  
That's a long long way from today babe  
As far as I can see  
So shake off your shoes  
Go and get me my booze  
Lay your love and your laces on me  
  
Gimme lace and whiskey  
Mamas home remedy  
Double indemnity  
Fills me with ecstasy  
La-aa-ace and whiskey  
La-aa-ace and whiskey  
La-aa-ace and whiskey  
La-aa-ace and whiskey


Somebody saw you at the station  
You had your suitcase in your hand  
You didn't give no information  
You walked off with another man  
I'm always standing in the shadows, baby  
I watched you give yourself away  
You take them home into your bedroom  
You had another busy day  
  
I tried to look the other way and fake it  
You push me to the limits  
I can't take it  
  
CHORUS  
One down, one to go  
Just another bullet in the chamber  
Sometimes love's a loaded gun  
Red lights, stop and go  
Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger  
Sometimes love's a loaded gun  
And it shoots to kill  
  
Someday they'll put me in a squad car  
Someday they'll throw away the key  
But 'til that day I'll be a mad dog  
Cause that's what you taught me to be  
  
You looked into the eyes of men above you  
I was the one who really tried to love you  
  
One down, one to go  
Just another bullet in the chamber  
Sometimes love's a loaded gun  
Red lights, stop and go  
Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger  
Sometimes love's a loaded gun  
And it shoots to kill  
Pull the trigger  
  
I tried to look the other way and fake it  
You know, you push me right to the limit  
I can't take it  
  
One down, one to go  
Just another bullet in the chamber  
Sometimes love's a loaded gun  
Red lights, stop and go  
Whatcha gonna do when you play with danger  
Sometimes love's a loaded gun  
And it shoots to kill  
  
Somebody saw you at the station

I was the boy who said all of my prayers  
Laid my clean face on the pillow  
Tucked in real tight, so safe and secure  
Through the night  
I heard a noise, it was probably nothing  
It pulled me right out of a dream  
If I knew it was you  
I'd have jumped out of bed with a scream  
  
I am the one who growls in your closet  
I am the one who lives under your bed  
  
[Chorus]  
Get down, back where you started  
Get down, back into hell  
Your black soul, you know you're black hearted  
I smell your sulfurous smell  
  
All of my things that I play with in daylight  
You turn into monsters at night  
My toys were my friends  
Until you taught them all how to bite  
  
You showed me things little boys shouldn't see  
You scared me with visions of fire  
You danced on my bed  
With the flames on your head dancing higher  
  
I am the one who growls in your closet  
I am the one who lives under your bed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I tell you right now  
I don't want your reptile embrace  
I don't want to follow you down to your place  
I don't want to be a child of disgrace  
You can take your whiskey soaked, foaming  
at the mouth, toilet talking, pea soup  
Spewing, sweating blood demon breath out of my face  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I was the boy who said all of my prayers  
Laid my clean face on the pillow  
Tucked in real tight, so safe and secure  
Through the night


Billie I wonder why are we insane  
Will we ever get better  
Will we stay the same  
Billie I'm worried  
  
Millie don't worry  
No one knows our pain  
Being in love is crazy not alone that way  
I know you're worried today  
  
God made love crazy so he wouldn't feel alone  
He was thinking of us he was thinking of us  
God made love crazy so he wouldn't feel so alone  
  
Billie my mind seems to wander  
To events of a night long ago  
Driving alone with our guilt well concealed  
In the trunk of your '68 Olds  
  
Millie our world's an asylum  
And our minds like you say ain't that straight  
But you know and I know our passion's  
Not deformed it's true to say  
We'll love our lifetime  
  
God made love crazy so he wouldn't feel alone  
He was thinking of us he was thinking of us  
God made love crazy so he wouldn't feel so alone  
  
Billie I dream of our children  
They're frightening and gruesome and sad  
And I don't want them growing inside me  
They're no price for the love that we have  
  
Oh Millie oh Billie criminally insane  
Oh Millie oh Billie  
  
Oh Billie it's fresh in my memory  
The night that it had to be done  
You with your pick axe and scissors  
And you with your shovel and gun  
  
And I liked your late husband Donald  
But such torture his memory brings  
All sliced up and sealed tight in baggies  
Guess love makes you do funny things  
  
Oh Millie oh Billie criminally insane  
Oh Millie oh Billie


I'm nuclear infected  
I really don't mind  
I just go out when the sun goes down  
And have a real good time  
  
I can clear out any ballgame  
In a minute and a half  
Just show up - glow up  
And have a real good laugh  
  
When I'm happy I glow yellow  
When I'm sad I glow blue  
And I glow red hot when I'm in bed with you  
  
I'm nuclear infected  
Really ain't that bad  
In fact it's about the best time  
I guess I ever had  
  
I'm nuclear infected  
Looking for a mate  
So slip on something lead, babe  
And go out on a date  
  
When I'm happy I glow yellow  
When I'm sad I glow blue, yeah  
And I glow red hot when I'm in bed with you  
  
Nuclear infected --- don't make me angry  
Nuclear infected --- don't make shake  
Nuclear infected --- don't get me to sneeze  
Nuclear infected --- that's a big mistake  
  
I want to live on Three Mile Island  
Where things are clean and neat  
'ause we don't have no health freaks  
Clutterin up our streets  
I'm nuclear infected, I need something to eat  
A China Syndrome Salad with plutonium and cheese  
  
When I'm happy I glow yellow  
When I'm sad I glow blue  
And I glow red hot when I'm in bed with you


Your cruel device  
Your blood, like ice  
One look, could kill  
My pain, your thrill  
  
I want to love you but I better not touch (don't touch)  
I want to hold you, but my senses tell me to stop  
I want to kiss you but I want it too much (too much)  
I want to taste you but your lips are venomous poison  
You're poison, running through my veins  
You're poison  
I don't want to break these chains  
  
Your mouth, so hot  
Your web, I'm caught  
Your skin, so wet  
Black lace, on sweat  
  
I hear you calling and it's needles and pins (and pins)  
I want to hurt you just to hear you screaming my name  
Don't want to touch you but you're under my skin (deep in)  
I want to kiss you but your lips are venomous poison  
You're poison, running through my veins  
You're poison  
I don't want to break these chains  
Poison...  
  
(Guitar solo)  
  
One look, could kill  
My pain, your thrill  
  
I want to love you but I better not touch (don't touch)  
I want to hold you, but my senses tell me to stop  
I want to kiss you but I want it too much (too much)  
I want to taste you but your lips are venomous poison

I want to taste you but your lips are venomous poison  
Yeah

Poison (Poi-son)  
Runnin' deep inside my veins  
Burnin' deep inside my brain  
Poison (Poi-son)  
And I don't want to break these chains  
Poison


I'm freezing, I'm frozen, I'm icicle blue  
(So low, low cool)  
Cyber, neurotic, technicians imbue  
(So low, low cool)  
I've been admitted to Refrigerator Heaven  
Until they discover the cure for cancer, I'm low  
Refrigerator Heaven  
So low, Refrigerator Heaven  
  
I'm ice packed, I'm hand-stashed, I'm waiting for you  
I'm older and younger, preserved in a tomb  
I've been admitted to Refrigerator Heaven  
I feel like I (told you a heart)  
I won't get back 'till the sun sets down on the moon  
Won't get back 'till m' sun sets down on the moon


Yeah, I'm such a liar  
One time I told you  
You were the highlight  
Of all of my sexual life  
  
While I'm confessing  
When you're undressing  
I was picking the lock  
On your safe with my knife  
Einstein  
  
If you're so naive  
That you believe  
Everything I said to you  
Well, I got your sex  
And wrote you rubber checks  
Well, what did you think  
I was gonna do  
  
My reputation for exaggeration  
It never got to you  
That's why I left Duluth  
Sometimes I stretch the truth  
  
My dearest darling  
You know that luggage  
It belonged to the blond  
With the really nice pair  
And incidentally  
I sorely missed you  
The pain was so hard to bear  
  
If I would rate you  
Not that I hate you  
But you would end up  
Eighth, maybe ninth in your class  
  
Your build is hot now  
If you could use your  
Brain like you use your ass  
  
Oh, you're so naive  
How could you believe  
Everything I said to you  
  
My reputation for exaggeration  
It never got to you  
Sometimes I'm so uncouth  
Sometimes I stretch the truth  
  
Hey, I'm such a liar  
One time I told you  
You were the highlight  
Of all of my sexual life  
  
I'm remarkably insincere  
Incredibly insincere  
Totally insincere  
Oh don't take it so hard, my dear  
I'm consistently insincere


Sitting on an angry chair  
Angry walls that steal the air  
Stomach hurts and I don't care  
  
What do I see across the way, hey  
See myself molded in clay, oh  
Stares at me, yeah I'm afraid heeey  
Changing the shape of his face, ooh... yeah

Shadows dancing everywhere  
Burning on the angry chair

Corporate prison, we stay hey  
I'm a dull boy, work all day ooh  
So I'm strung out anyway heey  
  
[GUITAR SOLO]  
  
Loneliness is not a phase  
Field of pain is where I graze  
Serenity is far away  
  
Saw my reflection and cried heey  
So little hope that I died, oh  
Feed me your lies, open wide heey  
Weight of my heart, not the size, oh  
  
I don't mind yeah  
I don't mind, aaah

Lost my mind, yeah

Pink cloud has now turned to gray  
All that I want is to play  
Get on your knees time to pray, boy


I broke you in the canyon  
I drowned you in the lake  
You a snake that I would trample  
Only thing I'd not embrace  
Oh, you couldn't dam that river  
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway  
So you couldn't dam that river  
And it washed me so far away  
I pushed and then you stumbled  
I kicked you in the face  
You stare at me so hollow  
Got to keep that killin' pace  
Oh, you couldn't dam that river  
  
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway  
So you couldn't dam that river  
And it washed me so far away  
I burned the place around you  
I hit you with a rake  
You piss upon my candle  
So proving you're a fake  
Oh, you couldn't dam that river  
And maybe I don't give a damn anyway  
So you couldn't dam that river  
And it washed me so far away

Care not for the men who wonder  
Straw that broke your back, you're under  
Cast all them aside who care  
Empty eyes and dead end stare  
  
Pre-chorus:  
Don't you know that none are blind  
To the lie, and you think I don't find..  
what you hide?  
  
Chorus:  
What in God's name have you done?  
Stick your arm for some real fun  
  
For the horse you've grown much fonder  
Than for me, that I don't ponder  
As the hair of one who bit you  
Smiling bite your own self, too  
  
Pre-chorus:  
And I think that you're not blind  
To the ones you left behind..  
I'll be here  
  
Chorus:  
What in God's name have you done?  
Stick your arm for some real fun.. AAH!!  
  
So be yearning all your life  
Twisting, turning like a knife  
  
Pre-chorus:  
Now you know the reasons why  
Can't get high, or you will die..  
Or you'll die  
  
Chorus:  
What in God's name have you done?  
Stick your arm for some real fun  
So your sickness weighs a ton  
And God's name is smack for some


In the darkest hole, you'd be well advised  
Not to plan my funeral 'fore the body dies, yeah  
Come the morning light, it's a see through show  
What you may have heard and what you think you know, yeah  
  
Let the sun never blind your eyes  
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind  
Hear a sound from a voice inside  
  
Sure to play a part, so you love the game  
And in truth your lies become one and same, yeah  
I could set you free, rather hear the sound  
Of your body breaking as I take you down, yeah  
  
Let the sun never blind your eyes  
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind  
Hear a sound from a voice inside  
  
In the darkest hole, you'd be well advised  
Not to plan my funeral 'fore the body dies, yeah  
  
Let the sun never blind your eyes  
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind  
Hear a sound from a voice inside  
  
Let the sun never blind your eyes  
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind  
Hear a sound from a voice inside


I want to make myself complete  
I want to hold it in my arms  
I want this blow to scar your eyes  
I want this pain to go away  
I want to shake this thinking here  
I wish there was a heaven  
  
Born to live, live to die  
Yeah, we're livin'  
Give to try, try to give  
Like this is heaven... And hell  
  
You want to write my name in blood  
You want to carve it in my arm  
You want to make yourself a dream  
You want this world under your thumb  
You want to make me shout and scream  
We know there ain't no heaven  
  
Born to live, live to die  
Yeah, we're livin'  
Give to try, try to give  
Like this is heaven  
Born to live, live to die  
Yeah, we're livin'  
Give to try, try to give

And we all know it well...  
  
Born to live, live to die

Love song, take one  
  
I love you and I'm coming back bitch  
I think I should say something  
I can't see you, I can't feel you, I can't, I can't  
  
Wash my face, cut out my teeth and tell me to grin  
My gums are bleeding  
My gums are bleeding  
  
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you  
Calling  
Don't forget your sheep  
First go up for air  
Get a fucking haircut  
Bring up the fleet  
Go fuck yourself  
What about  
Rae Dong Chung, Rae Dong Chung, Rae Dong Chung, Rae Dong Chung, Rae Dong Chung  
  
Get something, get, get them, get them  
Get the fuckin' midget  
Get the midget, get the midget  
Get the fuckin midget  
Kiss the fuckin' midget  
  
"Where the deer and antelope play"  
  
Kiss the midget, kiss the midget, kiss the midget, kiss the midget  
  
"That was perfect you guys, that was great!"


It's alright  
There comes a time  
Got no patience to search  
For peace of mind  
Layin' low  
Want to take it slow  
No more hiding or  
Disguising truths I've sold  
  
Everyday it's something  
Hits me all so cold  
Find me sittin' by myself  
No excuses, then I know  
  
It's okay  
Had a bad day  
Hands are bruised from  
Breaking rocks all day  
Drained and blue  
I bleed for you  
You think it's funny, well  
You're drowning in it too  
  
Everyday it's something  
Hits me all so cold  
Find me sittin' by myself  
No excuses, then I know  
  
Yeah, it's fine  
We'll walk down the line  
Leave our rain, a cold  
Trade for warm sunshine  
You my friend  
I will defend  
And if we change, well I  
Love you anyway  
  
Everyday it's something  
Hits me all so cold  
Find me sittin' by myself  
No excuses, then I know


OoooOh!  
  
I've had my share of one-night-stands  
And I've seen it all  
But you've got a hold on me  
Right against the wall  
  
Over the edge  
You've got me  
Over the edge  
Head over heels  
  
Over the edge  
Over the edge  
  
I never thought I'd see the day  
When I would want you there  
But nobody ever made me feel  
The way when you call  
  
Over the edge  
You've got me  
Over the edge  
Head over heels  
  
Over the edge  
Over the edge  
  
Over the edge  
You've got me  
Over the edge  
Head over heels  
  
Over the edge  
Over the edge  
  
I'm over the edge  
I'm over the edge  
Over the edge  
Over the edge  
Over the edge  
Now I'm over the edge  
Over the edge  
Over the edge  
Over the edge  
Over the edge  
Over the edge  
Over the edge  
I'm over the edge  
Over the edge


Give away a love  
And then remove another too  
Painted words adorn the walls  
Echoing untrue  
(I feel cold)  
  
Promises abound  
You rarely find it to begin  
Maybe I'm afraid  
To let you all the way in  
(I guess so)  
  
I excuse myself  
I'm used to my little cell  
I amuse myself  
In my very own private hell  
  
Lately I'm beside myself  
Pretending, unconcerned  
Standing on a corner  
Where I threw you on a turn  
(I'll move on)  
  
Flowers on a cross remain  
Mark an ending scene  
Damn it all if blood you spill  
Turn the grass more green  
(Life is short)  
  
I excuse myself  
I'm used to my little cell  
I amuse myself  
In my very own private hell


Heartbreaker, feelin' alright  
Body over, mind  
It's slower, reduction is addictive too  
  
Personality overview  
I can see what the cost will be  
You know I don't need you  
I just can't put you down  
I can see what it all means to me  
Honey I don't need you  
I just can't put you down  
I can't put you down

Everything you buy is for the jingle  
Every time you lie it's all the same  
Oh, if you need a rhyme to kill the singer  
Shoot me dead before I may be through


My daddy was a trucker  
Left home when I was three  
He fell for some dude in Austin  
Then it was mom and me  
She always wanted a daughter  
Well look at what she got  
A'hit me, beat me, a faggot I ain't  
But a real man they say I'm not  
I'm the queen, queen of the rodeo  
Queen, queen of the rodeo  
So cowboy, if you're lookin for lovin'  
I ain't no queer, go fuck a steer  
"I think there's one over there"  
I drink too much, I smoke too much  
I'm a human waste  
I buy a lot of cheap alcohol  
But I'll tell ya honey, I really hate the taste  
I dressed in drag, they call me a fag

What the hell am I?  
Thousand eyes, a fly  
Lucky then I'd be  
In one day deceased  
  
Sickman, sickman, sickman  
I can feel the wheel, but I can't steer  
When my thoughts become my biggest fear  
Ah, what's the difference, I'll die  
  
In this sick world of mine  
What the hell am I?  
Leper from inside  
Inside wall of peace  
  
Dirty and diseased  
Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman  
I can see the end is getting near  
I won't rest until my head is clear  
  
Ah, what's the difference, I'll die  
In this sick world of mine  
Can you see the end?  
Choke on me my friend  
  
Must to drown these thoughts  
Purity over rot  
"Yeah, though I walk through the valley of rape and despair  
With head high and eyes alert  
  
I tread on a plane of many  
We who are of good nature and intention,  
But cannot touch on the dark  
Recesses of memory  
  
And pain learned, so come walk  
With me, feel the pain,  
And release it..."  
What the hell am I?  
  
Worn eroded pride  
Saddened 10 miles wide  
I'm gonna let it slide  
Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman  
  
I can feel the wheel, but I can't steer  
When my thoughts become my biggest fear  
Ah, what's the difference, I'll die  
In this sick world of mine  
  
Ahh, etc., etc.

So close a lady  
Shifty eyes shady

A callous heart

Why you act crazy  
Not an act maybe  
So close a lady  
Shifty eyes shady

Full of sick desire

Burning corpsed pyre  
  
Then some dude came down to touch the Mother  
Mother touched, and dude ain't here no more  
Suck your woman down

Melting mirror smile

Do my love defile  
  
Then some dude came down to touch the Mother  
Mother touched and dude ain't here no more  
Ain't no day the sun don't crack

Mother said come home  
Father said come home  
Sisters said come home  
So my friends said come home

Can't you see, I'm just fine  
Little skinny, okay  
I'm asleep anyway  
Then I heard a voice  
  
Said son you have a choice  
I then slapped my face  
Let me be, I'm okay  
I'm awake anyway  
It's too bright over there  
I can shift, cannot steer  
  
So I drive them away  
For a while, then I stay  
Little skinny, okay  
I'm awake anyway  
Now I have to go home  
Do as, when in Rome  
  
Let me be, I'm alright  
Can't you see I'm just fine  
Little skinny, okay  
I'm asleep anyway  
Let me be, I'm okay  
I'm awake anyway

Hey now baby whatcha gonna do when I go?

Bodiy glistened while I listened  
To you screaming out his name in love  
Oh no no  
Hey now baby whatcha gonna do when I go?  
Hey yeah they say you love the girl  
While I'm wasted as you taste it  
Wicked pleasures, sins of flesh and blood  
Woke up drunk in the morning  
Sipping on my cup all day  
Stone cold bitch you're ballin'  
And I bet that you want to stay  
Well you go down to the city  
And you get yourself in line  
Cause if I don't need you baby  
I'll catch you another time  
Get This!  
Hey now baby whatcha gonna do when I go?  
Hey now baby who ya gonna do when I'm gone?  
Hey now baby whatcha gonna do when I go?  
Hey now baby who ya gonna do when I'm gone?  
I'm asking whatcha gonna do!


When The Morning Sun Streaks Across My Room  
And I'm Waken Up From Another Dream Of You  
When I'm On The Road, Once Again It Seems  
All that's Left Behind, Is A Chain Of Broken Dreams  
But You Know I Love You  
Yes I Love You, Oh.... I Love You....  
How I Wish That Love, was all We Need To Live  
What A Life We'd Have, Cause I've Got So Much To Give  
But It Seems So Wrong, Deep Inside My Heart  
That The Dollar Sign Should Be Keeping Us Apart  
But You Know I Love  
Yes I Love You.....Ohhh I Love You  
And If Only I Could Find My Way Back To The Time  
When The Problems Of This Life it Did not Cross your Minds  
And All The Answers could be Found In Children's Nursery Rhymes  
And I'd Come Running Back To You, I'd Come Running Back To You  
But You Know We Can't Live On Dreams Alone  
And To Pay The Rent, I Must Leave You All Alone  
And Though I Made My Choice Many Years Ago  
And now This Traveling Life Is The Only One I Know  
But You Know I Love You  
Yes I Love You, Oh I Love You  
But You Know I Love You  
Yes I Love You, Oh I Love You...  


This old house is falling down around my ears  
I'm drowning in a river of my tears  
When all my will is gone you hold me sway  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
  
You pull me like the moon pulls on the tide  
You know just where I keep my better side  
  
What days have come to keep us far apart  
A broken promise or a broken heart  
Now all the bonnie birds have wheeled away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
  
Come the night you're only what I want  
Come the night you could be my confidant  
  
Come the night you're only what I want  
Come the night you could be my confidant  
  
I see you on the street in company  
Why don't you come and ease your mind with me  
I'm living for the night we steal away  
I need you at the dimming of the day  
I need you at the dimming of the day


I hope that I won't be that wrong anymore  
I hope that I've learned this time  
I hope that I find what I'm reaching for  
The way that it is in my mind  
  
Someday I'll get over you  
I'll live to see it all through  
But I'll always miss  
Dreaming my dreams with you  
  
I won't let it change me  
Not if I can  
I'd rather believe in love  
And give it away  
As much as I can  
To those that I'm fondest of  
  
Someday I'll get over you  
I'll live to see it all through  
But I'll always miss  
Dreaming my dreams with you  
  
Someday I'll get over you  
I'll live to see it all through  
But I'll always miss  
Dreaming my dreams with you


When years seem like days to me  
No time on my hands  
I run away to a place in me  
To a faraway land  
  
When home seems so far from me  
Heaven's lights look dim  
It's just as far as my deepest heart  
Where my heart's Father lives  
  
His quiet voice speaking in silence everyday  
If I will only listen to the words He has to say  
I'll walk in His Spirit, see Him in my face  
I will live, 'cause He will live in my place  
  
When life seems so hard to bear  
When shadows look real  
The circumstance is your Father's care  
Go by faith not what you feel  
  
If you have been running too  
Stop now in your tracks  
Turn again to the one in you  
Put your burden on His back  
  
His quiet voice speaking in silence everyday  
If I will only listen to the words He has to say  
I'll walk in His Spirit, see Him in your face  
I will live, 'cause He will live in my place  
  
When years seem like days to me  
No time on my hands  
I run away to a place in me  
To a faraway land  


I think I'll take my foolish heart, my friend, and head right for the door.  
There'll be a better world waitin' if I do.  
'Cause I know I've been down this road a time or two before,  
The only time I let my heart turn to you.  
  
Now, I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true.  
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door.  
  
Still somethin' deep inside keeps tellin' me to make the sacrifice,  
And askin' me to walk the extra mile.  
I've walked it now to many times with freedom for the price.  
Too many times to fight back tears behind my smiles.  
  
Now, I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true.  
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door.  
  
I know I must seem quite unkind to wander off tonight  
And leave the moon up above to hold your gaze.  
It's only that my foolish heart is bound with foolish pride.  
Maybe some day I'll see the sunshine upon your face.  
  
Now I won't be blue with dreams that won't come true.  
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door.  
  
I'll take my heart, and head right for the door


Went to the fortune teller  
To have my fortune read  
I didn't what to tell her  
I had a dizzy feeling in my head  
  
Said she'd take a look at my palm  
Said "Son do you feel kind of warm?"  
And she looked into her crystal ball  
Said "You're in love."  
  
Said it could not be so,  
Not with all the girls I know.  
Said when the next one arrives  
Looking into her eyes.  
  
I left there in a hurry  
Much to my big surprise  
The next thing I discovered  
The fortune teller told me lies  
  
So I ran back to that woman  
Mad as I could be  
Told her I didn't see nobody  
How she made a fool out of me  
  
At last something shook me  
As if it came down from above  
And now the fortune teller  
And I fell in love


I've lived a life full of sorrow  
With no where to run or to hide  
Happiness you'll see is borrowed  
All I want is you by my side  
  
[Chorus]  
Gentle river take me away  
to the time of happier days  
All I need is love and company  
Gentle river bring him back to me  
  
You can spend all your time a'cryin'  
Listen here I don't need your sympathy  
Cause I've made my life to live it  
All I need is you here with me...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gentle river bring em' back to me


I left home when I was seventeen  
I just grew tired of falling down  
And I'm sure I was told  
The allure of the road  
Would be all I found  
  
And all the answers that I started with  
Turned out questions in the end  
So years roll on by  
And just like the sky  
The road never ends  
  
And the people who love me still ask me  
When are you coming back to town  
And I answer quite frankly  
When they stop building roads  
And all God needs is gravity to hold me down


I can hear those lonesome midnight sighs in your sleep  
I can hear the freight train's whistle cry, it's tellin' me  
It's telling me, oh darlin' can't you see  
Here comes that same old line, here comes goodbye  
Here comes goodbye, tonight  
Put a hold on all your lies, it's just not right  
It comes as no surprise, this time  
Any fool would realize, here comes goodbye  
Better take some time to talk it over again with me  
Better get all your things together now if you leave  
It's killin' me, oh darlin' can't you see  
Here comes that same old line, here comes goodbye  
Here comes goodbye, tonight  
Put a hold on all your lies, it's just not right  
It comes as no surprise, this time  
Any fool would realize, here comes goodbye  
I can hear your footsteps movin' slowly across my floor  
I can see your shadow look back at me outside my door  
What'cha waitin' for? Oh darlin' I know for sure  
Here comes that same old line, here comes goodbye  
Here comes goodbye, tonight  
Put a hold on all your lies, it's just not right  
It comes as no surprise, this time  
Any fool would realize, here comes goodbye  
Any fool would realize, here comes goodbye  
  


It was so right  
It was so wrong  
Almost at the same time  
The pain and ache  
A heart can take  
No one really knows  
But when the memories cling and take you there  
Till you no longer care  
You can let go now  
It's not right for me  
To cling to you  
Somehow I just needed time  
From what was to be  
It's not like me  
To hold somebody down  
But I was tossed high by love  
Almost never came down  
Only to land  
Where no love is found  
And I'm no longer bound  
I can let go now  
  


If I give my heart to you tonight  
Will you still be by my side?  
Or will you be gone with the morning sun  
Like a restless bird in flight?  
  
Take me in your arms  
Let the love you seek  
Wash away your sorrow,  
Let the morning be ours to keep.  
  
And if I should tell you of the love that I feel  
Will you still be there for me  
Or will I awake to a faded love searching for freedoms gain  
  
Take me in your arms  
Let the love you seek  
Wash away your sorrow,  
Let the morning be ours to keep.  
  
Take me in your arms  
Let the love you seek  
Wash away your sorrow,  
Let the morning be ours to keep.  
  
If I give my heart to you tonight  
Will you still be by my side?  
Or will you be gone with the morning sun  
Like a bird who yearns to fly?


If I could have the world and all it owns  
A thousand kingdoms, a thousand thrones  
If all the earth were mine to hold  
With wealth my only goal  
  
I'd spend my gold on selfish things  
Without the love that Your life brings  
Just a little bit more is all I'd need  
Till life was torn from me  
  
I'd rather be in the palm of Your hand  
Though rich or poor I may be  
Faith can see right through the circumstance  
Sees the forest in spite of the trees  
Your grace provides for me  
  
If I should walk the streets, no place to sleep  
No faith in promises You keep  
I'd have no way to buy my bread  
With a bottle for my bed  
  
But if I trust the one who died for me  
Who shed His blood to set me free  
If I live my life to trust in You  
Your grace will see me through  
  
I'd rather be in the palm of Your hand  
Though rich or poor I may be  
Faith can see right through the circumstance  
Sees the forest in spite of the trees  
  
If I could have the world...  
If I could have the world and all it owns


It doesn't matter what I want  
It doesn't matter what I need  
It doesn't matter if I cry  
Don't matter if I bleed  
You've been on a road  
Don't know where it goes or where it leads  
  
It doesn't matter what I want  
It doesn't matter what I need  
If you've made up your mind to go  
I won't beg you to stay  
You've been in a cage  
Throw you to the wind you fly away  
  
It doesn't matter what I want  
It doesn't matter what I need  
It doesn't matter if I cry  
Doesn't matter if I bleed  
Feel the sting of tears  
Falling on this face you've loved for years


The nights are so lonely and the days pass me by  
True love has faded, left me behind  
So we'll just move along and stop wasting time  
It's over all over now  
  
It's over, end of the line  
It's over and your doin' fine  
It's over and over and over, I'm asking why  
You're leaving it's over now  
  
Gone are the love songs that only we knew  
Robbed by the cold wind that sings the night through  
Gone is the sweet love, tried but untrue  
It's over all over now  
  
It's over, end of the line  
It's over and my desperate heart is still trying to find some way,  
Hoping you'll stay  
Cause it's over, all over now  
It's over, all over now


Through trials, troubles and care  
I know Jesus my savior is there  
Giving me faith through darkest days  
Keeping me on the narrow way  
Jesus savior, help me each day  
Fill me with hope, fill me with faith  
Darkness retreats at the touch of Your hand  
Jesus savior, help me to stand  
Jesus lived through darkest pain  
Rejected by men, despising the shame  
Man of sorrows, acquainted with grief  
He gave His life so we may be free  
Jesus savior, help me each day  
Fill me with hope, fill me with faith  
Darkness retreats at the touch of Your hand  
Jesus savior, help me to stand  
I know that Jesus died for me  
Canceled my debt at Calvary  
Rose from the dead, unlocked Heaven's door  
Trust in His love and live evermore  
Jesus savior, help me each day  
Fill me with hope, fill me with faith  
Darkness retreats at the touch of Your hand  
Jesus savior, help me to stand  


The sun came up on Monday morn,  
The world was all in flame.  
It's all a mortal man can do,  
To make it right again.  
  
Swing and turn Jubilee  
Live and learn Jubilee  
  
The moon came up I stood my ground,  
And swore to not give in.  
To never rest and do my best,  
To rid this world of sin.  
  
Swing and turn jubilee  
Live and learn jubilee  
  
The one who spoke cried tears of hope,  
That we might change in time.  
And when I looked into her eyes,  
The fear I saw was mine.  
  
Swing and turn jubilee  
Live and learn jubilee  
  
The time had come to travel on,  
I made my way alone.  
My soul will mend at journey's end,  
This road will take me home.  
  
Swing and turn jubilee  
Live and learn jubilee


Leaves were falling, just like embers,  
In colors red and gold, they set us on fire  
Burning just like moonbeams in our eyes.  
  
[Chorus]  
Somebody said they saw me, swinging the world by the tail  
Bouncing over a white cloud, killing the blues.  
  
Now I'm guilty of something  
I hope you never do  
Because there is nothing  
Any sadder than losing yourself in love.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And then you've ask me, just to leave you  
To set out on my own  
And get what I needed.  
You want me to find what I've already had.  
  
[Chorus x2]


I've spent my life  
Lookin' for you  
Findin' my way  
Wasn't easy to do  
But I knew there was you  
All the while  
And it's been worth  
Every mile  
  
[Chorus]  
So, lay down beside me  
Love me and hide me  
And kiss all the hurtin'  
Of this world away  
Hold me so close  
That I feel your heart beat  
And don't ever wander away  
  
Mornings and evenings  
All were the same  
There was no music  
Till I heard your name  
I knew when I saw you smile  
And now I can rest for a while  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And hold me so close  
That I feel your heart beat  
And don't ever wander away  
  
Love me and hide me  
  
Till I feel your heart beat


Gonna lay my burden down  
Lay my body in the ground  
Cold clay against my skin  
But I don't care at all  
  
Can't seem to find my piece of mind  
So with the earth I'll lay entwined  
Six feet underground  
My feet are warm and dry  
  
When I get to the other side  
I'll put your picture way up high  
But I'm not coming back to you  
It's just too far  
  
If I was cast off on the sea  
Would you come and look for me  
Or would you just let me sink  
Beneath the waves so blue  
  
What if I had learned to fly  
Fly all night till day drew nigh  
Touch down upon a branch and  
Scan the crowd for you  
  
When I touch my feet on the land  
I'll kiss your lips and take you in  
But you know I'm not here to stay  
It's just too far  
  
Darling can't you hear me cry  
My bones are broke  
My tongue is tied  
The moon is swaying back and forth  
Against the navy sky  
Is all I can see  
My body is trembling on my knees  
Just have a little mercy on me  
Run away and hide  
  
When I sleep the angels sing  
But I cannot hear a thing  
Eyes close  
Dreaming of the better days gone by  
  
When I wake the trumpets play  
And I'm standing at the gates  
Fall down and joy  
I know my race has just been won  
  
When I was young my momma would say  
Well life is hard, but that's O.K.  
If you can make it through the day  
It's not that far  
No, it's not that far


I wanna run away  
Don't come out looking 'round  
Too busy dealing with it on my own  
He's right behind me  
Please God I can't be found  
Don't cast another stone  
Feel out the night, until the sunrise  
The city tells me not to go 'til dawn  
And if he wakes that's when my heart breaks  
And I'm as good as gone  
  
How do I lie awake now  
When I know I've got to be moving on  
How do I lie awake now  
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong  
  
And in the end  
Will we make our amends  
Just like we're face to face another dawn  
And in the light, or when the moon shines  
Will you take me on home?  
  
How do I lie awake now  
When I know I've got to be moving on  
How do I lie awake now  
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong  
  
How do I lie awake now  
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong  
How do I lie awake now  
When I know I've got to be moving on  
How do I lie awake now  
When nothing's right and nothing's wrong


Oh my Lord, Please don't forsake me  
This is your child, I'm tired and sore  
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?  
I need your love, my soul is poor  
  
I can hear, the angels singing  
I can see those pearly gates  
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?  
I need a place where I can rest  
  
Oh my Lord, I can't remember  
When I first said, "Come in my life,"  
For I have lived my life in darkness,  
My whole world is filled with strife  
  
I can hear, the angels singing  
I can see those pearly gates  
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?  
I need a place where I can rest  
  
I can hear, the angels singing  
I can see those pearly gates  
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?  
I need a place where I can rest  
  
Oh my Lord, can you hear me?  
I need a place where I can rest.


You're the lucky one so I've been told  
As free as the wind blowing down the road  
Loved by many, hated by none  
I'd say you were lucky 'cause  
You know what you've done  
Not a care in the world, not a worry in sight  
Everything is gonna be alright 'cause  
You're the lucky one  
  
You're the lucky one always having fun  
A jack of all trades, a master of none  
You look at the world with a smiling eye  
And laugh at the devil as his train rolls by  
Give you a song and a one night stand  
You'll bee looking at a happy man 'cause  
You're the lucky one  
  
Well, you're blessed I guess  
By never knowing which road you're choosing  
To you the next best thing  
To playing and winning is playing and losing  
  
You're the lucky I know that now  
Don't ask you why, when, where or how  
You look at the world with a smiling eye  
And laugh at the devil as his train rolls by  
Give you a song and a one night stand  
You'll bee looking at a happy man 'cause  
You're the lucky one  
  
Well, you're blessed I guess  
By never knowing which road you're choosing  
To you the next best thing  
To playing and winning is playing and losing  
  
You're the lucky I know that now  
Don't ask you why when where or how  
No matter where you're at it's where you'll be  
You can bet you're luck won't follow me  
Just give you a song and a one night stand  
You'll bee looking at a happy man 'cause  
You're the lucky one


Yesterday the odds were stacked  
In favor of my expectations  
Flyin' above the rest,  
Never fallin' from the nest  
Tuesday came and went  
And now I'm in a little situation  
Maybe it's for the best  
I can live alone, I guess  
  
[Chorus]  
Maybe I can stand alone  
Maybe I'm strong as stone  
Even though the bird has flown  
Maybe he'll fly on home  
  
Forgive me if I'm keeping you apart  
From better conversation  
I'm hung up on all my doubt  
Trying to sort the whole thing out  
Tell me that I'm smart enough  
To deal with all the information  
Spinning inside my head  
Every word he ever said  
  
[Chorus: x2]


There's a chill on this evening, nights right for greaving,  
Darkness surrounds him as he wanders alone  
He walked past the dim lights, the pathways and street lights  
They remind him, of nights long ago,  
When his love was strong and his muscles hard, His whiskey throat was barley
marred,  
Seeking misfortune in the lies that he told, Then a brokin heart bought him to
his knees,  
In the hour of his greatest need, Lost and forsaken by the love, he could not
hold  
[Chorus:]  
On the Border line of love again, Its bound to make you pay  
On the Border line, we'll make our stand, Then watch it fall away  
And he stands in quiet solitude, The nights reflects upon his mood,  
Seeking the vision that had once been so clear, When he felt the touch of his
women's love  
His pounding heart was warm and young, Now locked inside him with his anger
and fear  
As he moves on slowly, past the trees, Down the path way home through fallen
leaves  
He can't believe, how he'd sunken so low, So he learned to live with his
injured pride  
His purple heart hidden, deep inside, The only reward, for a love he could not
hold  
[Chorus 2x]  
  
  


I've put it all behind me  
Nothin' left to do or doubt  
Some may say  
  
But every silver linin'  
Always seems to have a cloud  
That comes my way  
  
Anticipated pleasure  
Or unexpected pain  
No choice I feel  
  
Love is hard to measure  
Hidden in the rain  
That's why you'll find me  
  
Here all alone and still wonderin' why  
Waitin' inside for the cold to get colder  
And here where it's clear that I've wasted my time  
Hopin' to fly 'cause it's almost over now  
  
People come together  
People go their own way  
Love conquers few  
  
And I'll do whatever  
I'll say what I need to say  
Just not for you  
  
How many days should I smile with a frown  
'Cause you're not around with the sun on your shoulders?  
And how many nights must I wake up alone  
And know in my soul that it's almost over now?  
  
Love is like a paper airplane  
Flyin' in the folded dent  
Ridin' high, dippin' low  
But innocence is fair game  
I'm hopin' I can hold it in  
Our love will die, I know


Well, it's always we ramble, this river and I  
All along your green valleys, I work till I die  
My land I'll defend with my life need it be  
'Cause my pastures of plenty must always be free  
  
Green pastures of plenty from dry desert ground  
From the Grand Coulee Dam where the waters run down  
Every state in this union us migrants have been  
Lord, we come with the dust and we go with the wind  
  
California, Arizona, I harvest your crops  
Then it's on up North to Oregon to gather your hogs  
Take the beet from your ground, cut the grapes from your vine  
Just to place on your table your that light, sparkling wine


Sometimes I'm battle weary  
I forget to use my shield  
The arrows pierce my armor  
And I stumble in the filed  
A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side  
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive  
I'll think my life is over  
But the Lord he comes to me  
He heals my wounded spirit  
And he sets me on my feet  
A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side  
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive  
Sometimes your battle weary  
But the war's already won  
Keep your head and hold your shield high  
'Til your days of life are done  
A shield won't do much good if it's hangin' by your side  
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive  
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive  


Tonight, I waited but my heart is so cold  
'Cause you never stay more than a minute, so I'm told  
I know you're just doing your job  
But what am I supposed to do?  
When all I want for Christmas, darling, is to be with you  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby  
I watch you fill up my stocking  
But when I offer you some Christmas greetings  
You just keep on walking, yeah  
I'm not asking for a miracle, just a night  
And if you just look in my eyes, you just might  
There'll be no other woman who'll treat you like I can  
(Come on over here)  
I'll be your loving, darling, you'll be my loving man  
Oh, I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby  
I watch you fill up my stocking  
But when I offer you some Christmas greetings  
You just keep on walking  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby  
I watch you fill up my stocking  
But when I offer you some Christmas greetings  
You just keep on walking  
(Keep on walking)  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby  
You just keep on walking  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby  
I watch you fill up my stocking  
I watch you shimmy down the chimney, baby  


Who would sell their soul for love  
Or waste one tear on compromise?  
Should be easy enough  
To know a heartache in disguise  
But the heart rules the mind  
And the going gets rough  
Pride takes the fall  
When you find that kind of love  
  
I can't help feeling like a fool  
Since I lost that place inside  
Where my heart knew its way  
And my soul was ever wise  
Once innocence was lost  
There was not faith enough  
Still my heart held on  
When it found that kind of love  
  
Though beauty is rare enough  
Still we trust  
Somehow we'll find it there  
With no guarantee  
It seems to me  
At least it should be fair  
  
But if it's only tears and pain  
Isn't it still worth the cost  
Like some sweet saving grace  
Or a river we must cross  
If we don't understand  
What this life is made of  
We learn the truth  
When we find that kind of love  
Cause when innocence is lost  
There is not faith enough  
We learn the truth  
When we find that kind of love


What'll I do when you  
Are far away  
And I'm so blue,  
What'll I do?  
  
What'll I do when I  
Am wondering who  
Is kissing you,  
What'll I do?  
  
What'll I do with just  
A photograph  
To tell my troubles to?  
  
When I'm alone  
With only dreams of you  
That won't come true,  
What'll I do?  
  
What'll I do with just  
A photograph  
To tell my troubles to?  
  
When I'm alone  
With only dreams of you  
That won't come true,  
What'll I do?


When God dips his pen of love in my heart  
And he writes my soul a message he wants me to know  
His spirit all divine fills a sinful soul of mine  
When God dips his love in my heart  
  
Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul  
How he brought salvation and he made me whole  
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart  
Well he made me laugh and he made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire  
When God dips his love in my heart  
  
Well sometimes though the way is dreary, dark and cold  
And some unburdened sorrow keeps me from the goal  
I go to God in prayer, I can always find him there  
To whisper sweet peace to my soul  
  
Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul  
How he brought salvation and he made me whole  
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart  
Well he made me laugh and he made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire  
When God dips his love in my heart  
  
He walked up every step of Calvary's rugged way  
And gave his life completely to bring a better day  
My life was steeped in sin but in love he took me in  
His blood washed away every stain  
  
I said I wouldn't tell it to a livin' soul  
How he brought salvation and he made me whole  
But I found I couldn't hide such a love as Jesus did impart  
He made me laugh and he made me cry, set my sinful soul on fire  
When God dips his love in my heart


Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue  
When you say it's my fault anyway?  
You turn your head from the tears I've shed  
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you  
You justify yourself in your love for someone else  
When you say, I never loved you anyway  
Your vows were made in vain, although my love still remains  
Though you broke my heart in two, who can blame you  
Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue  
When you say it's my fault anyway?  
You turn your head from the tears I've shed  
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you  
In a heart of rusty steel you kept your love affair concealed  
'Til the day she was asking you to stay  
You turned your head from the tears I've shed  
Though you broke a heart in two, who can blame you  
Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue  
When you say it's my fault anyway?  
You turn your head from the tears I've shed  
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you  
Who can blame you, though your heart's untrue  
When you say it's my fault anyway?  
You turn your head from the tears I've shed  
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you  
You turn your head from the tears I've shed  
Though your heart is untrue, who can blame you  


You may walk away in anger  
Wear your heart upon your sleeve  
You make act like it don't matter  
Keep me laughing while you leave  
But burning bridges won't get me back  
If you change your mind some day  
Why can't we turn this scene around  
Before you walk away?  
Will you be leaving, leaving me today?  
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand  
Crumbling in our hand  
I can't live this scene again  
You may turn away in silence  
While the tears run down your face  
Say there's nothing left to bind us  
Leaving love without a trace  
But if I loved you well  
You'd soon find out why your new love falls some day  
Why can't we burn this heartache down  
Before you walk away?  
Will you be leaving, leaving me today?  
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand  
Crumbling in our hand  
I can't live this scene again  
Will you be leaving, leaving me today?  
Like the ocean leaves us waiting on the sand  
Crumbling in our hand  
I can't live this scene again  
  


God's given us years of happiness here  
Now we must part  
And as the angels come and call for you  
The pains of grief tug at my heart  
  
Oh my darling  
My darling  
My heart breaks as you take your long journey  
  
Oh the days will be empty  
The nights so long without you my love  
And when god calls for you I'm left alone  
But we will meet in heaven above  
  
Oh my darling  
My darling  
My heart breaks as you take your long journey  
  
Fond memories I'll keep of happy ways  
That on earth we trod  
And when I come we will walk hand in hand  
As one in heaven in the family of god  
  
Oh my darling  
My darling  
My heart breaks as you take your long journey


Hear a new girl moved to the town  
Now your baby just ain't no where to be found  
Now you think you're in dispair - no  
You feel that chill - that cold black clinging in the air  
  
Love's a game - you're in it  
And you're so proud

Let me stay here never once said that we're through  
You didn't fight it all the way, no  
But I don't care - you just don't mean that much to me this way  
  
Love's a game - you're in it  
And you're so proud

No matter what you say  
You won't come  
Running back to you're arms  
It's all over baby  
Well it don't do no good to cry


Don't come around here no more,  
Bringing me all of your bad rain.  
Can't you see I've got troubles of my own.  
I ain't got time to be messing with all of your bad rain,  
Why in the world can't you just leave that stuff alone?  
There was a time we had a good thing going on,

So, don't come around here no more,  
Bringing me all of your bad rain.

Why in the world can't you just leave that stuff alone?


By The Hourglass  
  
Waiting in the rain at the station,  
Standing by the train,  
Looks like you're comin home to stay.  
It's been quite a while since you've seen him,  
Now, inside you smile against the rain,  
Cause you still feel the same.  
  
But, you're gonna cry, and search for the reason why,  
Carry your pain and you'll finally go insane.  
Uh, cause you, baby,  
Whoa, you been gone much too long.  
  
You can't believe there's no one there to greet ya now,  
You can't believe that no one cares,  
To take your hand, you want your man.  
  
But, you're gonna cry, and search for the reason why,  
Carry your pain and you'll finally go insane.  
Uh, cause you, baby,  
Whoa, you been gone much too long.  
Yeah, baby, much too long.  
Whoa, much too long.  
You went away a long time ago.


Silent shadows of the night  
Faded with the morning light  
We just wrote another song  
Maybe a word or two is wrong  
There's so much that could be said  
It's hard to write it in a line  
But when the final word is read  
Maybe something could be said  
For all the brothers of the road  
Just like you, we bear a heavy load  
Been through hell and back again  
If we don't lose we're bound to win  
  
Somehow they gave it all a name  
Just like a southern hurricane  
We play our music like a storm  
They say a brand new sound was born  
We're all brothers of the road  
Just like you, we bear a heavy load  
Been through hell and back again  
If we don't lose we're bound to win  
  
Some of us fell along the way  
We came together, not too proud to pray  
But the music must go on  
So there's no one left out there all alone  
We're just brothers of the road  
Casting shadows in the night  
Big wheels rolling on and on  
But everything's gonna be all right


Another day in the life of a stranger  
Surrounded by four walls that can't be seen  
He knows this dude that lives uptown and he delivers  
He often calls him for that perfect dream  
But oh, he's got his demons  
And they stay right by his side  
Through his everyday hell, yeah  
  
He loves his wine and his pretty women  
He buys them everything just to stay around  
He's got it made cause his daddy's got a bundle  
He seldom reaches out but there's no one to be found  
Except oh, he's still got them demons  
And they stay right by his side  
In his man-made hell  
  
Oh, he's got his demons  
And they by his side  
Another dar in the life of the lonely  
All alone in a sold out crowd  
He can always buy some cheap thrills with his money  
His world of silence has become much too loud  
But ho, don't forget them demons  
They're still right by his side  
Causing all kinds of hell, yeah


Yeah sad eyed woman

Were gonna mess around and have a little fun  
When that good time feelin comes around  
  
[Break]  
  
Well I can't get enough of that wonderful stuff  
Never felt so fine, hey now drivin me out of my mind  
Someone said it can't be done...  
Were gonna mess around and have a little fun  
When that good time feelin come around  
When that good time feelin come around  
When that good time feelin come around


Mama stood cryin' at the back door  
Papa's lacin' on his leavin' shoes  
Little Joe's blowin' on the horn outdoors  
I've seen enough, I can't take no more  
And I'm leavin'  
  
Might go to Philadelphia, PA  
Might wind up in Boston, I just can't say  
Got my axe in one hand  
Got my Greyhound ticket in the other hand  
And I'm leavin'  
  
I tell you I'm leavin'  
Gonna play my blues  
Yes I'm leavin'  
Got nothing to lose  
Well, I'm dying to get the hell out of here  
Right away  
  
Mama stood cryin' at the back door  
Papa's lacin' on his leavin' shoes  
Little Joe's blowin' on the horn outdoors  
I've seen enough, I can't take no more  
And I'm leavin'  
  
I said I'm leavin'  
Gonna play my guitar  
I'm leavin'  
Don't care if I'm a big star  
I'm leavin' this old ghetto  
Right away, right away


Well, now, times got hard  
And I didn't draw the card I needed  
So, I proceeded to bang it on down the line  
Hitchhike, turnpike  
And if you got room, won't you let me ride?  
Just as far as you're going  
And, Lord knowing, I'll be much obliged  
  
There was a light rain falling  
I started recalling how lonesome a man can be  
Feeling a chill when over the hill  
Came a brand new baby blue Cadillac  
Stop on a dime  
I threw my guitar in the back, and I climbed inside  
Big blue eyes said, "Hey, boy, don't you want a ride?"  
  
I said, "To Birmingham, Alabama  
Or to Nashville, Tennessee will do just fine with me  
Don't you know what I mean?  
I'm coming from New Orleans  
Now, hey  
Mama, won't you let me ride?"  
  
Well, now, black fur coat, diamond ring  
Shining like something I ain't ever seen  
My old guitar and a roadside bar  
Walked in the door looking like a movie queen  
There was a honky-tonk jukebox, hardwood floor  
She said, "I ain't ever seen nothing like this before."  
I said, "That's all right, mama, won't you let me ride?"  
  
On down to Birmingham, Alabama  
Or to Nashville, Tennessee will do fine with me  
Don't you know what I mean?  
I'm coming from New Orleans  
Now, hey  
Mama, won't you let me ride?"


This city mean old world, try livin' by yourself  
This city mean old world, try livin' by yourself  
Can't get the one you love, have to use somebody else  
  
I've got the blues, gonna pack my things and go  
I've got the blues, gonna pack my things and go  
Guess you don't love me, lovin' mister so and so  
  
Solo (Two times)  
  
Sometimes I wonder why can your love be so cold  
Sometimes I wonder why can your love be so cold  
I guess you don't love me, gonna pack my things and go  
  
Solo (to end)


Well I love you baby, but you won't give me the time of day.  
Well I love you baby, but you won't give me the time of day.  
Treat me so bad, but I love you anyway.  
Early in the morning sun begins to rise,  
Early in the morning sun begins to rise,  
Call out your name, wring my hands and cry  
Got me runnin', don't know what to do,  
There won't be much of me when you get through.  
Down on the bottom, nothing left to lose,  
Lord I got 'em, mean woman blues.  
Well, I love you baby, but you don't even know my name.  
Well, I love you baby, but you don't even know my name.  
Don't care about me but love you just the same.  
Now, someday baby, take you by the hand,  
Yeah, someday baby, take you by the hand,  
You be my lovin' child and I'll be your lovin' man.  
Yeah, you got me runnin', don't know what to do,  
There won't be much of me when you get through.  
Down on the bottom, nothing left to lose,  
Lord I got 'em, mean woman blues.  
Got me runnin', don't know what to do,  
There won't be much of me when you get through.  
Down on the bottom, nothing left to lose,  
Lord I got 'em, mean woman blues.


Got the blues like midnight.  
Honey won't be long 'fore day.  
Got the blues like midnight.  
Honey won't be long 'fore day.  
Wish that tornado would blow my blues away.  
Lord, I can tell my bulldog  
when I hear him bark  
Lord, I can tell my baby  
when I hear her in the dark.  
Got the blues like midnight.  
Honey won't be long 'fore day.  
Got the blues like midnight.  
Honey won't be long 'fore day.  
Lord I wish a tornado would blow my blues away.


Walk me out in the morning dew, my heart  
Walk me out in the morning dew, my heart  
You know I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my heart  
Oh, I can't walk you out in the morning dew, my heart  
Thought I heard a young girl cry, yeah  
Thought I heard a young girl cry, yeah  
No, you didn't hear no young girl cry at all  
No, you didn't hear no young girl cry  
Thought I heard a young girl cry, yeah  
Thought I heard a young girl cry, yeah  
No, you didn't hear no young girl cry  
No, you didn't hear no young girl cry at all  
Now there is no morning dew  
Now there is no morning dew  
What they've been saying all these years has come true  
What they've been saying all these years has come true  
Got no morning dew, oh  


Well I don't know, if I dreamed it.  
I don't know, might be real.  
Lord, it's so strange, how one will find another,  
But I keep on searchin', cause I know you're out there,  
And all I gotta do is open my eyes and see her - the mystery woman.  
Cause I'm confused, but only sometimes.  
Patiently waiting, baby just for you.  
But I'll be leavin', babe, I won't go under.  
All I gotta do is open my eyes and see her - a mystery woman.  
  
If I have to chase her, all around the country.  
Well I'm bound to find her somewhere, and that's no lie.  
Ain't it strange, how one will find another,  
But I'll keep on searchin', cause I know you're out there,  
All I gotta do is open my eyes and see her - a mystery woman.  
All I gotta do, is open my eyes and see you - my mystery woman.  
Hey, yeah - my mystery woman.


Oh-oh  
  
Walking in the midnight rain  
Thought I heard a southbound train  
Call your name  
Nancy  
  
Walking in the rain all day  
Guess there wasn't nobody goin' my way  
They didn't stop at all  
But I will get back to you if I have to crawl  
  
Nancy I told you in my letter  
Things didn't appear to be no better at all  
And this ol' highway's a hell of a line  
Nancy I just spent my last dime to make this call  
Oh Nancy  
I'll get back to you if I have to crawl  
Oh yeah  
  
[solo]  
  
Oh yeah, mmmmm  
  
I left my home for a job in the city  
It's a crying shame  
It's a pity  
It ain't livin' at all  
Nobody knows my name  
They don't even give a thang about me t'all  
Nancy  
Baby I'm getting back to you if I have to crawl  
Ohh  
  
Nancy I told you in my letter  
Things didn't appear to be no better at all  
This ol' highway's a hell of a line  
Nancy I just spent my last dime to make this call  
Nancy  
Baby I'll get back to you if I have to crawl  
Oh yeah yeah oh oh  
Oh Nancy  
Oh Nancy


I need someone's hand to lead me through the night  
Need someone's arms, to love and squeeze me real tight.  
And when the lights are low, when it's time to go,  
I need your love so bad.  
I need some soft lips to hold so close to mine  
Need someone to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin  
When the lights are low, and when it's time to go,  
I need your love so bad.  
So give it up, and bring it on home to me.  
Oh you can write it on a paper so it can be read to me.  
Tell me you love me, stop drivin' me mad,  
Cause I need your love so bad.  
I needed some voice, to take me through the night,  
Don't you worry baby, I will not fuss and fight.  
Well listen to my plea, now bring it on home to me,  
Cause I need your love so bad.  
Well, I need your love soooo bad.  
Soooo bad. So baaad. Soooooo bad.

Time and time again I've felt these wall's of plaster,  
Closing in,  
And more than once I've felt that lonely lonely feeling,  
Wondering why and where I've been,  
Just about the time, I think I can't hold on,  
You're always there to keep me hanging on and I say,  
  
I never knew how much a man needed a woman  
(no I never)  
I never knew how much a boy needed a girl  
(needed a girl)  
I never knew how much I needed you  
  
Day after day I join the rat race,  
Tryin' to make the most of it,  
I keep on falling down down the ladder,  
Still trying to stay on top of it,  
Just when I was sure,  
Nothing could get no better,  
Oh I realize,  
I still love you more than ever,  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Today I watch the sun set on the freeway,  
Strangled on the poison air,  
But miles beyond, on the other end,  
I know, you'll always be waiting there,  
Girl you treat me,  
With your kindest hand,  
And in my heart, in my mind,  
And I'm so glad  
  
[Chorus:]


As I was motivating back towards town  
I seen a Cadillac sign, it said no money down  
So I eased on the brake, and I pulled up there in the drive  
I gunned up the motor and then I walked on inside  
The dealer came down and said man trade that Ford  
I can put you in a car that will eat up the road  
Now you just tell me what you want  
And then sign on this line  
I'll have it brought right to your house  
In about an hour's time  
  
I'm gonna get me a car  
And I'm gonna head on down the road  
Ain't gonna have to worry no more  
Bout that broke down raggity Ford  
  
Well mister I want a yellow convertible a four door deville  
Man I want a continnetial spare and some white chrome wheels  
And power steering and uh a power brakes  
And a powerful motor with a jet off take  
Some nice cool air condition and some nice warm heat  
And a big old feather bedroom pillow in the back seat  
I want a ship to shore radio a colour tv and a phone  
So I can talk to my honey while I'm riding alone  
  
I wanna get me a car yeah  
And head on down the road  
I don't have to worry no more  
Bout that broke down raggity Ford  
  
And also I want four carburetors and I want two straight exhaust  
I want a nuclear reactor and I don't care what it cost  
I want a railroad air horn I want a phycadellic strobe spot  
And I want a 15 year guarantee on everything that I got  
I want a two dollar deductible and I want a 20 dollar note  
I want a 150, 000 dollars liability and that's all she wrote

And head on down the road  
I don't wanna have to worry no more  
Bout that broke down raggity Ford


You know hard times, just an old friend, just an old friend to me  
I say hard times, just an old friend, just an old friend to me  
Tell me now old friend, oh when you gonna let me be?  
  
Can't you feel a cold wind, howlin' down, blowin' my song  
Can't you feel a cold wind, it's howlin' down, blowin' my song  
Well I ain't an old man, oh but you know my time ain't long  
  
Gonna be a hard rain - you can hear it in the distance, sounds so near  
Gonna be a hard rain - can't you hear it in the distance, sounds so near  
People when the rain comes, oh it's gonna wash us all away from here  
  
Mean old woman, people won't you tell me where can she be  
Mean old woman, oh people won't you tell me where can she be  
She's the only woman, oh that ever meant a damn to me  
  
You know hard times, just an old friend, just an old friend to me  
I say hard times, just an old friend, just an old friend to me  
Tell me now old friend, oh when you gonna let me be?  
Tell me now old friend, oh when you gonna let me be?  
Tell me now old friend, when you gonna let, this poor man be?


Sunset colors, all across the bay.  
Finds me here alone at the end of one more day.  
Skipping stones across the water.  
Wonder why I ever thought you'd stay.  
  
Palm trees sway in the evening breeze.  
Sing a lullabye of sweet love to me.  
Sailboat, sail away into the amber sky.  
And I wonder why I ever thought you'd stay.  
  
Sail on, sail away.  
May all your dreams come true one day.  
Sail on, sail away.  
I wonder why I ever thought you'd stay.  
  
Sail on, sail away.  
May all your dreams come true one day.  
Sail on, sail away.  
I wonder why I ever thought you'd stay.  
I wonder why I ever thought you'd stay.  
  
Sail on, sail away.  
Sail on, sail away.  
Sail on, sail away.  
Sail on, sail away.


Lately I don't know where I went wrong,  
But the spell of that pretty young girl is far too strong,  
Between her fine perfume and angel face,  
My whole world became another place.  
The dark side of her intelligence was so strong,  
Soon there'll be no difference in right or wrong.  
Next thing I know I had a key that unlocked her door.  
I could not wait to hear the siren song,  
The beginning of the end of my happy home.  
Sailin', sailing 'cross the devil's sea, oooh, hooo,  
too blind in love, too blind to see.  
Heard them say the payback's double-fold,  
Just can't seem to remember who I bought and sold.  
I'll probably still be here when you come around next year,  
Trying to climb from this deep dark hole.  
I'll be damned if I just don't feel I'm growin' old.  
Sailing, sailing 'cross the devil's sea, ohhh, hooo,  
Too blind in love, too blind to see.  
Cause she was eviler than evil, slippery like a fox,  
set me up with pain and woe and, I swear it won't seem to stop.  
If I could just remove her hook from deep from within my soul,  
Swear I'll leave and not come back, just let me out that door.  
Sailin', sailing 'cross the devil's sea, ohhh, hooo,  
Too blind in love, too blind to see.


I've had my troubles,  
I know you've had your troubles too.  
Sometimes when you need a little sunshine,  
It keeps rainin' down on you.  
  
But I'm not gonna let it get me down,  
Keep on pullin', things are gonna come around.  
Shine it on,  
Shine it on.  
  
Little blue-eyed woman,  
She made me feel so fine.  
She got what she wanted,  
Then she moved on down the line.  
  
Yes I know about the pain,  
Tears are gonna fall,  
Just like rain.  
  
[Chorus]  
Shine it on,  
Look around you see what's goin' on.  
Shine it on,  
Before you end up out there on your own.  
Don't let some rainy day, steal your heart away,  
You got to go on,  
It's just the dark before the dawn,  
Shine it on.  
  
Shine it on,  
Look around you see what's goin' on.  
Shine it on,  
Before you end up out there on your own.  
  
Don't let some rainy day, steal your heart away,  
Shine it on,  
Look around you see what's goin' on.  
Shine it on,  
  
Before you end up out there on your own.  
Shine it on, oh baby.  
Shine it on, shine it on, shine it on,  
Shine it on.


You've heard every line before  
My life's a revolving door  
With no way out and no way in  
You know just what's on my mind  
Could you take a chance one more time  
Maybe we could start all over again  
  
Straight from the heart  
Straight from the heart  
Straight from the heart  
Straight from the heart  
  
Your eyes can't tell a lie  
I can see what you're feeling inside  
Don't give up before we start  
?Cause this time love is  
Straight from the heart  
Straight from the heart  
  
I know what they're telling you  
I wish I could say that it's not true  
Love is so hard to find  
But I never took the time  
I never let you in  
Please let me try again  
Straight from the heart  
  
I thought I knew about love  
But I didn't know at all  
Didn't take the time to see  
Until I started to fall  
Straight from the heart  
Straight from the heart  


Whatever happened to good time Sally  
I don't see her 'round no more  
She used to be all over me  
It ain't like that no more  
Sally had the best game there was in town  
Now the good girl just can't be found  
Whatever happened to good time Sally  
I don't see her 'round no more  
  
The heat is on, everybody has gone underground  
The heat is on, everybody hiding out just like Jesse James  
My old home town  
Lord, it don't seem the same  
  
Well, I walked in this place, I was just lookin' for a game  
Everybody here wanted to know my name  
I said hush, hush up your mouth, I'll introduce my own self  
To this house  
I was born in the back woods, I was raised up like a slave  
Having me a good time now is all I crave  
I spotted me a barroom queen, skin tight blue jeans  
That same old midnight show  
I took her to the side and I said I won't be satisfied  
Until you tell me everything you know  
  
Whatever happened to big time Buddy  
I don't see him 'round no more  
I heard tell that they got him in jail  
But I don't know what they got him for  
They caught him with an airplane  
Talkin' 'bout some cocaine  
Nobody knows for sure  
Whatever happened to good time Buddy  
I don't see hem 'round no more  
  
The heat is on, everybody has gone underground  
The heat is on, everybody hiding out just like Jesse James  
My old home town  
Lord, it don't seem the same


The Weight  
  
I pulled into Nazareth, was feeling 'bout half past DEAD  
I just need some place where I can lay my head  
Hey, mister, can you tell me, where a man might find a bed  
He just grinned and shook my hand, "No" was all he said.  
Take a load off Fanny, take a load for free  
Take a load off Fanny, and you put the load right on me  
I picked up my bags, I went looking for a place to hide  
Then I saw old Carmen and the devil walking side by side  
I said, "Hey Carmen, c'mon, let's go downtown"  
She said, "I gotta go, but my friend can stick around"  
  
Chorus  
  
Go down, Miss moses, ain't nothin you can say  
It's just old Luke, and Luke's waiting on judgement day  
Well, Luke, my friend, what about young Annalee  
He said, "Do me a favor, so, won't you stay and keep Annalee comapany"  
  
Chorus  
  
Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog  
Said, "I will fix your rag, if you'll take Jack, my dog"  
I said, "Wait a minute Chester-you know, I'm a peaceful man"  
He said, "That's ok, boy, won't you feed him when you can"  
  
Chorus  
  
Get you cannonball, now to take me down the line  
My bag is sinking low, and I do believe it's time  
To get back to miss Fanny, you know she's the only one  
Who sent me here, with her regards for everyone  
  
Chorus


Well here you come again  
Claiming to be my long lost friend  
I can tell you're wearing thin  
You're trying to play those same old evil tricks again  
  
No, no nobody  
Not even you, babe  
No, no nobody  
Is gonna do the things you used to do  
  
A wise man tried to warn me  
But I would not hear a word  
Just can't say that I feel badly  
About all the bridges I have burned  
  
No, no nobody  
Not even you, babe  
No, no nobody  
Is gonna do the things you used to do  
  
If you knew someone like I know you  
You can hear their footsteps  
And know exactly who they are  
You ain't worthy my time or money  
Much less my heart  
Yet here you are again  
Who the hell do you think you are  
  
You've got a million dollar smile  
And a half-a-dollar soul  
You're a living lesson baby  
And your story's getting old  
  
No, no nobody  
Not even you, babe  
No, no nobody  
Is gonna do the things you used to do


You're coming back into my life  
After all this time apart  
After my heart has been broken in two  
Now you want to turn around and go back through  
All the hurt, all the pain  
I'm not sure it could ever be the same  
  
'Cause two rights can't make up for one wrong  
I've spend so many nights alone  
One kiss can't make it disappear  
Even though you're here tonight  
Baby two rights can't make up for hurting someone  
  
I guess you think it's all a game  
Someone gets hurt, someone gets blamed  
You don't seem to realize  
There's someone else  
In my eyes  
  
'Cause two rights can't make up for one wrong  
I've spend so many nights alone  
One kiss can't make it disappear  
Even though you're here tonight  
Baby two rights can't make up for hurting someone  
  
You're the one who wanted to play the field  
Now you can't find a love that's real  
It's your game, but it's no fun  
When you end up the lonely one  
  
'Cause two rights can't make up for one wrong  
I've spend so many nights alone  
One kiss can't make it disappear  
Even though you're here tonight  
Baby two rights can't make up for hurting someone


Across the river a good woman cried  
All because a foolish man lied  
She gave up everything  
Everything that money could buy  
But the man told so many lies  
There's another man over there  
That woman across the river  
Sweet woman across the river, she was mine  
Word got around that he had jilted her  
Men came running from near and far  
Should've never been so foolish  
Guess I'll never  
But the man that's got her now  
He's a lucky so and so  
That woman across the river  
Sweet woman across the river, she was mine  
I remember the other day, about a week ago  
She said, "I don't even want to talk to you  
'Cause I don't love you anymore"  
That woman across the river  
Sweet woman across the river, she was mine  
Across the river a good woman cried  
All because a foolish man lied  
She gave up everything, tried to keep him satisfied  
But the man told so many lies  
There's another man over there  
That woman across the river  
That woman across the river  
That woman across the river  
Sweet woman across the river, she was mine  


You don't love me, pretty baby,  
You don't love me, yes I know.  
You don't love me, pretty baby  
You don't love me, yes I know.  
  
Well if you leave me, pretty baby  
Don't you know you're gonna hurt me so.  
Well I'm gonna tell my mother,  
I'm gonna talk to my father too.  
Well I'm gonna tell my sweet mother,  
I'll have a word with my father too.  
Well I'm gonna tell everybody,  
What those young girls will do to you.  
  
Goodbye now, pretty baby,  
If I don't see you no more.  
Lord, goodbye now, pretty baby,  
If I never see you no more.  
Well if you think I'll be your fool, Lord,  
You better be on your merry way.


Acrobats and comets floating by so fast  
Children's faces smile like suns at last  
Lilac butterflies are cruising without fear  
All inviting you to stay and rest here  
  
You can halt your car for an afternoon in utopia  
We shall stop the wars on those afternoons in utopia  
Mighty Mao moondog drifts across the grass  
Healing lullabies for easter time on mars  
  
Paint your hats and shoues with flowers and with stars  
Singing in metropolitan operas  
You can halt your car for an afternoon in utopia  
We shall stop the wars on those afternoons in utopia


Ain't it strange that we destroy  
What we embrace  
And we leave  
What we seek  
It's such a shame  
Ain't it strange that we smile  
When we cry  
And no one knows why we are here  
And where we going to  
Ain't it strange  
We could be, we could be so good together  
Ain't it strange that we share what we hate  
That we break what we love  
It's such a shame  
Ain't it strange when we pray, we betray anyway  
And no one knows what we are for  
Why we're so tough  
When we're so fragile  
Ain't it strange  
  
Ain't it strange, still we could fall into a dream, I'd wish no one  
Will catch that fall  
For we could fall for love, life is but a dream, life is but a dream  
All the tears in the world not in vain for the pain is gone, the  
Shame is washed away  
When we're all one, life is but a dream, life is but a dream  
It's hard to believe after thousands of years  
The world is still drowning in blood and tears  
We've been quite advanced but again we fail  
It is dog eats dog on the ratrace trail  
It is getting too much and we're getting nowhere  
While hatred and fear is all that we share  
I can't take it no more when I'm watching the news  
We must stick together or we're bound to lose


Show me a place that ain't hell  
If there's space, give me room to breathe  
That's all that I need for this body can't fail  
And if music be the food of love  
Play on, give me excess of it  
Let it all out, please let me out of here  
And I shall rise from the ashes  
  
Grow like a rose from the ruins  
There must be light in the darkness  
Hope at the end of the night  
Yes, I've been tryin' all my  
Life to get to heaven  
But awoke in the eye of the storm  
But I shall rise from the ashes  
Grow from the ruins and return back home  
  
This is a call from the goals coming up  
To the prisoners of pleasure  
Drunk on the blood of the next generations  
And I've been through many strange confusions  
Splitting myself into to many faces  
Now the mirror is broken  
I can see the worms behind  
You may well have your ways of triumph  
You may well have your ways of truth  
  
Just gimme some room to breathe  
That's all that I need  
Me and my strange friends  
We all belong to the grand astral body  
Take my hand and I take you out of here  
And there's you behind those legendary curtains  
Take my hand before you wither in the crowd  
  
And I take you out of here  
This is the end of the show I don't know  
Was I wrong was I right  
Oh love, I don't know, I wasn't perfect for sure  
But now I feel like a new born baby  
Lying in the dew of the morning  
Laughing at the sky like a brave new Apollo


Driving down the streets, listening to the radio  
What do I get: ariana  
Reading the papers and the news they scream  
Haven't you heard: ariana  
She rules the business, she's sucha restless genuine juvenile  
Everyone knows, wherever she goes  
She got chique, she got class, she got style  
Arianamaniacs rulr the world, haven't you heard  
Arianamania sets the scenes on fire  
We're goin' nutz for ariana  
We're goin' carazzy forrr herrr  
Everything glows, wherever she goes  
She got sex from her lips to her toes  
All the casanovas, even zombies agree  
With the hummingbirds and the beasts from the sea  
Ariana's a real sensation  
When will she be on the screeeeeen


These are the days of evil perfection  
This is the world of torture and fame  
This is the age of most vicious infection  
These are the times of terror and pain  
  
Let them inside and they build you a nightmare  
Show them, you fool, it'll not be in vain  
Here is your costume of deepest surrender  
These are the times of terror and pain  
  
I want to ride on a crest of sensation  
I want to scream in the whirlpools of love  
I want to drown in a climax of thunder  
I want to be with the fools in the storm  
  
Do what you want and then die when you want to  
We're gonna walk on the blood of the meek  
We're gonna sail through the oceans of wonder  
We're gonna live in the dreams that we seek  
  
Send in the parasite clowns on their horses  
Send in the idiots and let them advance  
Send in the monsters of your own creation  
Send them all in and give them a chance  
  
We're gonna dance to the sweetest of music  
We're gonna play with the whores in the rain  
We'll dissipate the lord's last temptations  
All in a crossfire of torture and fame


she sits by the window, stares into the night  
just waiting for a foreign sound from outside  
far beyond the atmospheres, she is listening for a call to take her homewards  
to herself  
oh, i love you so  
he who's master of the icy shots won't harm you in the morning  
she knows that the pavement's hard, there between the stars  
to travel on to martian homesick city  
she is weeping silently but there's not a tear  
just raindrops falling from the painted ceiling  
the dance of the foraging bee will number all the things  
she has been longing for all of her life  
i will not pass this night in vain, she says  
i'll stand this kind of rain  
i know the way, i'll find the path  
yes, carol wants to go to mars, back where the red-cold sun is sinking  
to the channels of a'daar  
day breaks through the grating  
someone moves a chair  
and sunlight blisters dazzling on a glass  
take a pill and greet the day for sedative holidays  
why aren't you sleeping in the night  
oh, i love you so  
he who's master of the icy shots won't harm you till the evening  
we shall meet tomorrow night  
and i'll kiss you just as tenderly as cygnus kissed the deserts


Pushing through the market square  
So many mothers sighing  
News had just come over, we had five years left to cry in  
News guy wept and told us, earth was really dying  
Cried so much, his face was wet, then I knew, he was not lying  
  
I heard telephones, opera house, favorite melodies  
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and tv's  
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare  
I had to cram so many things to store, everything in there  
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people  
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people  
I never thought I'd need so many people  
  
A girl of my age went off her head, hit some tiny children  
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off, I think she would have killed them  
A soldier with a broken arm  
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a cadillac  
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest  
And a queer threw up at the sight of that  
  
I think I saw you in an icecream parlour  
Drinking milkshakes cold and long  
Smiling and waving and looking so fine  
I don't think you knew you were in this song  
And it was cold and it raind, so I felt like an actor  
And I thought of ma and I wanted to get back there  
Your face, your race, the way that you talk  
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk  
  
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes, we've got five years, what a surprise  
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot, we've got five years, that's all
we've got  
We've got five years...


I forgive, I forgive  
I forgive all my friends who left me alone, I forgive the wall that it had so
many stones  
I forgive the lord that he never sent a priest, I forgive the hangman, I
forgive the beast  
I forgive the winter that it was so cold, I forgive my father that he was so
bold  
I forgive the ashes that they couldn't stay flames, I forgive the acid, I
forgive the rains  
I forgive James Joyce that I couldn't read his books,  
I forgive that you've never given back what you took  
  
I forgive the puzzle that I didn't fit, I forgive the shit that I couldn't
write a hit  
I forgive the dog that she never came home, I forgive all the ways that they
always lead to rome  
I forgive the worm in the very last tree, I forgive the girls who haven't
forgiven me  
I forgive inspiration when it came to late, I forgive all the ladies when I
had to wait  
I forgive superman that I didn't stay clean, I forgive, I forgive, anyone,
anything  
For the sake of love, for the sake of love  
For the sake of love  
  
I forgive the angels who could never take me high,  
I forgive all my dreams that I couldn't really fly  
I forgive the thought that I couldn't stop thinking,  
I forgive all the drinks that I couldn't stop drinking  
  
I forgive the clock that it didn't wake me up, I forgive the driver, I forgive
the cab  
I forgive all the moments that they wouldn't stay, I forgive all the years
that they've flown away  
I forgive the promises that they've been broken, I forgive the curses that
they have been spoken  
I forgive all the prophets and the saints of the past, I forgive the stars
when they fell too fast  
I forgive the joke that it didn't make me laugh, I forgive desire that I had
to starve  
I forgive all the love for the sake of love, I forgive all sakes for the fake
above  
For the sake of love, for the sake of love  
For the sake of love


Let's start in style, let's dance for a while,  
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies.  
Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst,  
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?  
  
Let us die young or let us live forever  
We don't have the power, but we never say never  
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip  
The music's for the sad man.  
  
Can you imagine when this race is won?  
Turn our golden faces into the sun,  
Praising our leaders, we're getting in tune  
The music's played by the madman.  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young.  
Do you really want to live forever?  
Forever, and ever  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young  
Do you really want to live forever?  
Forever young.  
  
Some are like water, some are like the heat  
Some are a melody and some are the beat  
Sooner or later they all will be gone  
Why don't they stay young?  
  
It's so hard to get old without a cause  
I don't want to perish like a fading horse  
Youth's like diamonds in the sun,  
And diamonds are forever  
  
So many adventures couldn't happen today,  
So many songs we forgot to play  
So many dreams swinging out of the blue  
Oh let them come true  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young.  
Do you really want to live forever,  
Forever, and ever?  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young.  
Do you really want to live forever,  
Forever young?  
  
Forever young  
I want to be forever young  
Do you really want to live forever,  
Forever, and ever?  
  
Forever young,  
I want to be forever young.  
Do you really want to live forever?


Be on your guard when you sit in the open places  
because I'm blessed with all the wonders of the sun  
when tigers, palmtrees, rattlesnakes unfold their graces  
that kind of magic you may get a sunburn from  
and there's no better way for us than our old sweet ways  
and angels burn to dust before the human race  
we're giants under a rainbow  
we're stranded east of eden  
Sometimes we're crying in the afterglow  
in a world of broken toys, how can we live without them  
freedom that is what you are always screaming  
it is a scream but more a nightmare than a laugh  
those without faith are liars even when they're dreaming  
I'd put my faith in god if he knew how to dance  
but there's no devil in the darkness, no demon in the skies  
nothing to be afraid of, cross my heart and hope to die  
freedom...  
Freedom...


I wish I'd had the time to look into your eyes  
And quietly say the words  
The words that you'd expect  
I wish I'd touched your face  
And you would hold my hand  
Then tears were on our guard  
And silence was our friend  
And we would leave behind the chaos in our lifes  
The struggle and the strife and the black and white  
And all the letters that we wrote  
Would be printed out in gold  
In our memories to behold  
Without explanations  
To be told...  
I dreamt I had the time to listen what you'd say  
And what you'd say was true and we could start anew  
I saw u bachstage in that chair  
Dressed up in lies but oh so fair  
And then I took you by the hand and off we went  
And we just drank to quench our thirst  
That never dies and always burns  
Deep in the night out on the streets  
I'd like to kiss you too but it wouldn't do  
And all the poems that we wrote  
Would be printed out in gold  
In our memories to behold  
Without explanations  
To be told...  
And we would leave behind the chaos in our lifes  
The struggle and the strife and the black and white  
And all the letters that we wrote  
Would be printed out in gold  
In our memory to behold without explanations...  
And we just drink to quench our thirst  
That never dies and always burns  
Deep in the night out on the streets  
I'd like to kiss you too without explanations..  
To be told.


Though this place is so crowded  
You feel so alone 'cause you're eye to eye with him  
And you know he will take you  
He's got nothing to lose and there's no way for you to win  
Desperados in love won't kill this sweet dove  
For nuggets of fleeting bliss  
C'mon, c'mon you can't escape  
The bleeding bullet of a kiss  
Here comes that golden feeling  
It's shining in your eyes  
We're always going on and on  
Right from that day they start to shine  
It's a new situation  
The start of a game, you've already won the prize  
He's a lunatic dancer  
Who's not aware that he's skating on thin ice  
There's no turning back  
No time for regrets, you should've known better, though  
Another chance to fall in love  
Another chance to turn you on  
Another chance to turn you on  
Here comes that golden feeling  
It's shining in your eyes  
We're always going on and on  
Right from that day they start to shine


Be my guard just for tonight, that is all I'm asking for  
Take me under your wing, I can't make it anymore  
I am so full of fear, may you read a book to me  
And when the shadows grow, won't you stay with me  
Will you be my guard tonight, that is all I'm asking for  
Will you be my guard tonight, that is all I need to know  
Be my guard beside my bed, that is all I need to know  
Will you please hold my hand, don't you ever let it go  
All the wonders of the world  
For a little second more  
I can't speak but can't you see  
It's your touch I'm crying for  
Will you be my guard tonight, that is all I'm asking for  
Will you be my guard tonight, that is all I need to know  
Be my guard just until dawn  
When I can hear the birds again  
I'm as helpless as can be  
Will you guard my little flame  
If we never meet again  
You shall always keep in mind  
That you were my guard tonight  
That you were my guard tonight  
Will you be my guard tonight


We call ourselves the crown of creation  
I wonder what does it mean  
We're not the owners of the moon and the earth  
It's like a roundabout  
And it goes round and round for free  
We've made some gruesome inventions  
Yet we're mastered by those systems  
We're endangered danger, we're running out of fashion  
If we don't care for responsibility, hey-hey  
We're endangered danger, we're endangered danger  
We're the headlines today but all that we say is  
We're endangered danger  
Eric says that we're a lonely species  
That's why we're playing the fools  
But once we'll enter the aquarian age  
I sometimes catch him floating in his swimming-pool  
He says  
If we'd tune in to our brighter sides  
We'd feel like Jesus on the waters  
Cause we're sailors not soldiers  
So much more for this show  
Than a guest-appearance in the universe, here we go  
We're endangered danger, we're endangered danger  
We're the headlines today but all that we say is  
We're endangered danger


Now at the station, the train to another land  
Lands of never seen light  
Light hidden in infinite night  
Night in it's biggest might, might of the strongest power  
And there the smoke of the train  
To the heart of the flower  
I take the first train to the heart of the flower  
I take the first train to the heart of the flower  
And there the smoke of the train  
To the heart of the flower  
And there the smoke of the train  
To the heart of the flower  
The waiting room of kingdom come,  
I look back upon my life  
Life of loss but now the end  
End of rat race overdrive  
Overdrive to foreign lands  
Lands of contemptuous hours  
And there the smoke of the train  
To the heart of the flower  
Now on the train  
This is the end of my day  
I feel my spirits escape like a musical clock  
That's dying away  
I turn once again and wave my hand  
And say goodbye  
I never thought it's so easy  
I never thought it's so easy  
I take the first train to the heart of the flower  
i take the first train to the heart of the flower  
And there the smoke of the train  
To the heart of the flower  
And there the smoke of the train  
To the heart of the flower  
The heart of the flower  
The heart of the flower  
The heart of the flower


Once I awoke  
The shadow of your smile had crossed my mind  
How could I know this was your last goodbye  
That's slipping through the windmills of the night  
  
You never understand when she's talking to you,  
Little boy  
You never understand when she's talking to you  
She's too far away  
  
Is it heaven or hell  
We're drifting in the wake of our dreams  
And the world is a clown who cries  
And no one can tell is it real  
Once I cried  
  
Whenever I awoke without you  
A stranger in the thunder of the dark  
I'm praying to the sun to shine tonite  
You never understand when she's talking to you,  
  
Mon amour  
You never understand when she's talking to you  
She's too far away...


When you feel so far away  
Though you're close to everything  
And the feeling of estrangement's  
Creeping up on spider's legs  
Even in these days of wonder  
Even in the age of faith  
There are some who goin' under  
There are some who got it made  
In the middle of the night  
When the last of god has died  
And the only thing you've got  
Is the tic toc of the clock  
I'm here by your side  
In these days full of wonder  
So you passed so many years  
In a labyrinth of traces  
Running round and round they led  
To no one but yourself


If you open up the cage  
You will hurt yourself  
The king said it's forbidden  
Or you may get hell  
But the prisoner lets you know  
Where to find the key  
Under her satin pillow  
Yes, there it has to be  
Modesty is fine but it doesn't take you very far  
When you make your decision  
Don't be afraid of the dark  
Longing for the golden ball  
That it will be yours for keeps  
Be sure about it as you saw  
So shall you reap  
  
Lets take a ride on Iron John's shoulders  
He has more gold than anybody in this world  
Lets take a ride, hey-ho on Iron John  
He has more gold  
Than anybody in this world  
  
Jump on the train to nowhere  
From now on you are free  
After rising from the ashes  
You'll become a mystery  
Too many of those strange injections, too many gazes at the sun  
The lady says, well that's the business, running after No. 1  
For all their childish daydreams you caught their falling stars  
Just for the cheapest contracts you signed your autographs  
And if you started much too early, therefore you stopped too late  
Make sure no one can stop you now, here comes the ultimate  
  
Lets take a ride  
  
He will be with you, he will be there when you call out the magic words  
  
Lets take a ride


Here is the news from my little hideaway  
My sweet Ivory Tower  
I've sent you songs about so many thing  
Mighty moon dogs skipping waves  
Dolphins playing their lives away  
Golden circus girls and pharaohs  
Fallen angels, street side Romeos  
  
Patricia's park and Anyway  
Eternal youth and never ending summer days  
Lonely girls, music halls, the mysteries of love  
In the event that I don't return  
Please take this message to understand  
In the event  
I am a stranger in a strange land  
  
Welcome, stranger, to the land of the free  
Welcome, Carol, to Phantasy  
Oh my God, I feel so alone  
A million light years far from home  
It seems to be a tragedy  
How can I live in Germany?  
  
Another house is burning down  
It's time to face the cruel reality  
This is a game no more  
Disasters in the 20th Century  
In the event that I don't return  
Please take this message to understand  
In the event that I don't return


At the edge of the moon there's a lonely man  
And he blows on his horn as strong as he can  
And the girl at the bar wipes the breath  
Of winter away with a smile of her face  
  
And a little black dog barks along with a loon  
Is this my appointment or did I come too soon  
Got a strange invitation for tea time  
'Twas given by somebody I can't recall  
  
It's the middle of the riddle, it's not very serious  
It's nothing but a big surprise  
And the president's horse is a rabbit of course  
That is living in a big boy's mind  
  
Living in a big boy's mind  
And I skate on a knife on a wire  
That is strung from this song to a distant shore  
And then I say  
  
Intuition is just another phase of chance  
While we're crawling through the old pyramid's floors  
(little pharaohs)  
And the little black dog, here it comes again  
  
It's a true companion in a foreign land  
On a quest for the valley of boojums  
And birthdays and phonecalls I cannot recall  
All of man shan't talk to the one at the helm  
  
And the man at the helm shall talk to no one  
Shall talk to no one at all  
(Rule 42)  
And a horse is a rabbit of course  
  
(yes, indeed)  
Yes, a horse is a rabbit of course


Once I was so sure, once I was so blind  
Wonder what you said if you read my mind  
Angel in a car, devil on a cross  
Scarecrows in the fields, Jesus on the rocks  
Letters in the rain, rabbit on the run  
God was made for you, lizards for the sun  
Monkey in the moon, I can see you through  
Monkey in the moon, this one's made for you  
  
  
Flower in a word, words without a priest  
Wings without a bird, beauty without beast  
Signal overkill, trains are overdue  
Fool upon a hill, ocean overview  
Letters in the rain. . .  
Fool upon a hill, trains are overdue  
Except what we forgot nothing's really new  
Head above the clouds, eyes are opened wide  
Windmill burning down, walk into the light  
Walk into the light  
Monkey in the moon...  
Letters in the rain  
This one's


you gave me strength, you pushed the blades away from me  
oh how we dreamt to change the world  
and we would never give in, no matter what they say  
a really cool connection in a cruel world  
you led me through the nights - and through the hardest fights  
we dreamt wed be the ones - and we would never lose  
you made me speechless - and fearless - yet it made you fearless too  
oh how we dreamt to be so fearless - no matter what they do  
i dont know where you are now - we shared a dream of being together  
you led me to the light, yeah - for this i would like to thank you forever  
moonboy...  
youve been around, a distant star, youve seen them come and go  
those unknown chaps without a slightest chance  
i know, all without faith are liars even when theyre dreaming  
id even put my faith in god if he knew how to dance  
our minds are filled with crazy dreams - they seem to be unreachable  
but if you give them up they stay - till someone else takes them away  
i met you in this hotel hall - oh nino, aint it hard  
not to be understood  
but all you said was: hey, i just wanna sing (like an angel)  
i dont know where you are now - we shared a dream of being together  
you led me to the light, yeah - for this i would like to thank you forever  
moonboy...  
i dont know where you are now - you come and go whenever you like..  
just believe in your powers - you might find out youre invincible...  
no matter what they say...


Once, we were together  
Once we were one  
Once we were running, we knew where we came from  
We were the music, we heard the call  
We were giants after the fall  
Once we were children, once we were so small  
  
To the new horizons I cast my eyes  
When I look at you reaching out to the new horizons  
Once and today  
Once and today  
  
Once, we were divided, once, we lost our sight  
Once, we were freezing in the tv light  
You are a rainbow, you're looking fine  
Shall we make it one more time  
  
To the new horizons I cast my eyes  
When I look at you reaching out to the new horizons  
Once and today  
Once and today  
You are a rainbow


Baby, if you say you still care,  
I follow you most anywhere  
Roll away the stone,  
Roll away the stone  
And in the darkest night,  
I'll keep you safe and alright  
Roll away the stone,  
Roll away the stone  
Won't you roll away the stone,  
Why be cold and so alone  
Won't you roll away the stone,  
Don't you let it lie  
No matter if fools say we can't win,  
I know I'll fall in love again  
Roll away the stone,  
Roll away the stone  
So sing, we still got a chance,  
Baby for love and sweet romance  
Roll away the stone,  
Roll away the stone  
Won't you roll away the stone  
Don't you let it die  
Just kick it away

continental sister's rocking with the liquid gambler  
now the time is here, now it's coming true  
the enigmatic extasy is overwhelming you  
acrobats and comets are streaking by  
40.000 sirens are wailing at the sky  
innersexual circuits are cruising without fear  
all inviting you for partytiming here  
that's the start of the new sensation..  
...dig that band  
listen to me, listen to the voice of the dolphin  
you better return to the sea  
listen to his majesty  
you better return to the sea  
you better return to me..


There's no more place to go  
the other bars are closed  
the night the stranger came to town  
how do you know  
when you're right or wrong?  
How do you know  
if you hurt or if you don't?  
So many people say so many things  
but nobody agrees on anything  
there's no more place to go  
shadows she said  
there's no more place to go  
shadows she said  
this night's an empty shell  
shadows she said  
and all the shadows followed after her  
you burned the book of life  
the cradle and the tomb  
how could you ever dare  
there's no more turning back  
your stars lit up in flames  
there's gunsmoke in the air  
and yesterday you bought a brand-new car  
but you don't feel like going very far  
there's no more place to go...  
There's no more place to go  
shadows she said  
there's no more place to go  
shadows she said  
this night's an empty shell  
shadows she said  
and all the shadows followed after her  
here they come...  
Shadows she said...  
And all the shadows followed after her...  
Shadows she said...


Did you know when the journey started  
That wed ever reach that point  
Many years we sailed together  
Now its time to say goodbye  
You don't know what I've been going through  
haven't heard that much from you  
Isolation is a nice flower  
Now I wonder what to do  
You never know when your dreams come true  
Is it good for you, is it good for you  
On our ship of fools were drifting along the shores never seen before  
When you told me that youre leaving  
Cause the stakes were much too high  
I was wondring why you said so  
Since we still got wings to fly  
I will never ever give up  
Just as long as I am here  
Till the end Ill spread my wings  
And raise my dreams against your fears  
You never know when your dreams come true  
Is it good for you, is it good for you  
On our ship of fools were drifting along the shores never seen before...


Tell me is it really true  
There's something goin' on  
Outside  
I just can feel it  
I heard it on the radio  
I'm not allowed to go  
Outside  
I can't believe it  
There's a big hole in the sky  
Where the radiation's breaking through  
And we just sit and stare  
Like the rabbit at the snake  
There's so much we could do  
But we gotta do it now  
Cause it's gettin' pretty late  
Better hurry now  
We all need the sun  
We need love and light for everyone  
We need our atmosphere  
To live in here  
We could be so strong  
We overthrow the government and stop  
What's goin' wrong  
We're fighting for the sun  
It's really hard to understand  
The change of sister sun  
As if your sunny smile  
Would turn into a deadly one  
It's not a quality of life  
To live inside a mighty trap  
To have that ice-cold coke beyond the radiation gap  
There should be more resistance  
Against industrial trusts  
And if there's no solution, there should be revolution  
I wonder if we start in time, we're racing with the seconds  
I wonder if we've got enough to talk to stupid politicians  
We all need the sun...  
Hold on to revolution... Members of the earth, lets fighting for the sun

There is too much confusion  
Much too much impact of obscene terror  
I wonder why I'm still surfing on this wave of obsession  
Is there a reason to stay any longer  
Waiting for some cool messiah  
Give me a reason to stay here forever  
Waiting for something to come  
Is it my soul  
Is it that glimpse of light I never forget to expect  
Or is it you, some kind of angel  
That keeps me in waiting forever  
There's too much war on the outside  
Much too much impact of symbols and meanings  
I wonder why I'm still fighting in this ocean of questions  
Is there a reason to stay any longer  
Waiting for something to come  
Give me a reason to stay on this island  
Waiting for something to come


It's a trick of my mind  
Two faces bathing in the screen light  
She's so soft and warm in my arms  
I tune it into the scene  
My hands are resting on her shoulders  
When were dancing away for a while  
Oh we're moving, we're falling,  
We step into the fire  
By the hour of the wolf in a midnight dream  
There's no reason to hurry  
Just start that brand new story  
Set it alight, we're head over heels in love  
Head over heels  
The ringing of your laughter  
It sounds like a melody  
To once forbidden places  
We'll go for a while  
  
It's the definite show  
Our shadows resting in the moonlight  
It's so clear and bright in your eyes  
It's the touch of your sighs  
My lips are resting on your shoulder  
When we're moving so soft and slow  
We need the ecstasy, the jealousy,  
The comedy of love  
Like the Cary Grants and Kellys once before  
Give me more tragedy, more harmony  
And fantasy, my dear  
And set it alight, just starting that satellite  
Set it alight  
  
The ringing of your laughter  
It sounds like a melody  
To once forbidden places  
We'll go for a while


This day's an invitation  
And it's just for you  
You've got a reservation  
For the 17th of June  
  
Open your eyes  
And let the sun break in for a while  
There may be something  
That you've never seen inside  
  
Feel how your heart beats  
Like a heavy machine  
The sound of the traffic  
Is like a silent dream  
  
The dust in the park  
The exhaust from the cars  
Ascends in that heated afternoon  
(You touch a sweaty body!)  
  
Summer in Berlin, it's alright  
The day feels so tired  
From the lead in the air  
And the fire in the skies  
  
Life seemed to be a fault of grace  
But it's ok  
It gave you a kiss  
In the middle of the crossroads  
  
Summer in Berlin, it's alright  
The heat of the sun  
Which is stored in the pavement  
Feels so fine  
  
Here stands the innocent  
And there it comes oh so wild  
That's when you're longing  
For a summer by the wall  
  
Summer in Berlin, it's alright  
Summer in Berlin, it's ok


(.. Dahinter schimmern die sterne)  
May I introduce myself  
I'm your poison  
I'm gonna kill you tonite  
I do it slowly, you gonna like it  
You remember me for the rest of your life  
But it won't last very long, hang on  
It won't last very long, so hang on  
To the opium den  
I hang out here every nite  
I'm just waiting, I'm just waiting for you  
You gonna like what i..., you gonna like it  
You gonna like what I do  
But it won't last very long, hang on  
It won't last very long, so hang on  
To the opium den...  
May I introduce myself  
I'm your poison, I'm gonna kill you tonite  
I do it slowly, you gonna like it  
You remember me for the rest of your life  
But it won't last very long, hang on  
It won't last very long, so hang on  
To the opium den...  
It offers you comfort  
As everything about it  
It is mild, without reason  
And for all it is perfect  
And it is there, where I go now  
And it is there, where I now go  
And it is there, where I now go  
It is there... Where i... Now... Go..


(Gold-Lloyd-Echolette)  
  
This is a national anthem  
From the flip-side of the empire  
Hand on my heart  
Heart on the sleeve of the constitution  
Sinking right into a mirror  
Leaving reflections on its surface  
Caught in a kind of radio-beacon  
That's sending out signals  
Transmitting them backwards  
Hey, tell me it's true  
Is this the other side of you  
Worlds gonna change  
With a move in your face,  
Do I still walk on the same structure?  
Hey, what do we know  
Re(a)leasing arrows over cosmic meadows?  
Nothing is real  
Even iron or steel  
Melting gently in the cold structure  
Watching your face thru' a peephole  
As I lean against the door  
Can't understand what you say  
But I think that you're calling my name  
Leaving the ones I loved is like  
Leaving the one they want me to be  
Making decisions  
In real-time-precision  
As millions of sailors  
In parallelworlds  
Hey, tell me it's true,  
Is this the other side of you  
Worlds gonna change  
With a move in your face  
Do I still walk on the samestructure?  
Hey, what do we know,  
Re(a)leasing arrows over cosmic meadows?  
Nothing is real  
Even iron or steel  
Melting gently in the cold structure  
Everybody walks this side of the run-way  
Everybody hopes to get off the trap  
All we really like is to groove with emotion  
Waiting for the airline to lift us up...


Into the night  
Still falls the rain  
Even the dogs stay home tonight  
Out on the streets  
Going nowhere  
Just one direction in my thoughts  
Love can be magic  
It can be a game  
Sometimes it's tragic  
And sometimes a shame  
Words were my bullets  
Emotion my gun  
I was a runner  
Now I'm on the run  
Sometimes I wish that you were dead  
That is because you haunt me so  
I wasn't right to let you go away  
I try to kill the pain inside  
But you are always on my mind  
No matter where I go or stay  
Sometimes I dream my time away  
And we're together again  
But I know that can never be  
And all my hopes are in vain  
You were my treasure  
That I didn't know  
You were the sun in my life  
Thought I was dying  
When I realized  
There's just one chance to survive.


On the first part of the journey  
I was looking at all the life  
There were plants and birds and rocks and things  
There was sand and hills and rings  
The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz  
And the sky with no clouds  
The heat was hot and the ground was dry  
But the air was full of sound  
  
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name  
It felt good to be out of the rain  
In the desert you can remember your name  
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain  
La, la  
  
After two days in the desert sun  
My skin began to turn red  
After three days in the desert fun  
I was looking at a river bed  
And the story it told of a river that flowed  
Made me sad to think it was dead  
  
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name  
It felt good to be out of the rain  
In the desert you can remember your name  
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain  
La, la  
  
After nine days I let the horse run free  
Cause the desert had turned to sea  
There were plants and birds and rocks and things  
There was sand and hills and rings  
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground  
And a perfect disguise above  
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground  
But the humans will give no love  
  
You see I've been through the desert on a horse with no name  
It felt good to be out of the rain  
In the desert you can remember your name  
Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain  
La, la


Eyes  
Holdin' back the tears  
That they've held for years  
How can I tell you?  
I don't want to make you cry  
Why should I even try?  
Why should I even try?  
Days  
Where'd you go so fast  
Fin'lly lost at last  
How can I tell you?  
I don't want to let you down  
Why should I even try?  
Why should I even try?  
How can I tell you?  
I don't want to let you down  
Why should I even try?  
Why should I even try?  


It's late at night, I'm all alone  
I call you up, hear your voice on the phone  
Say that you're mine, tell me it's true  
Say that my love, is still right for you  
  
'Cause I can't fall asleep to a lullaby  
And I miss you so much I don't wanna cry, you are why  
I love you, oo-oo-oo, you don't know  
  
Here I am, part of the crowd  
Need you so bad, I'm dreamin' out loud  
Say that you're mine, tell me it's true  
Say that my love, is still right for you  
  
'Cause I can't fall asleep to a lullaby  
And I miss you so much I don't wanna cry, you are why  
I love you, oo-oo-oo, you don't know  
  
It's late at night, and I'm all alone  
So I call you up, to hear your voice on the phone  
Sayin' your mine, sayin' it's true  
Please say my love, is still right for you  
  
'Cause I can't fall asleep to a lullaby  
And I miss you so much I don't wanna cry, you are why  
I love you, oo-oo-oo, you don't know


Written by dan peek, (C)1976  
Found on hideaway and highway.  
  
Alone, sitting here on my own  
There's no place I'd rather be  
Or so it seems  
  
Home, miles away from home  
And there's no place I'd rather be  
Can't you see?  
  
You hold your life in your hands  
And no one takes from a man  
Who gives the best that he can  
To make someone understand  
  
I've flown miles away from home  
And there's no place I'd rather be  
Can't you see?  
  
You hold your life in your hands  
And no one takes from a man  
Who gives the best that he can  
To make someone understand  
  
Home, miles away from home  
And there's no place I'd rather be  
Can't you see, can't you see, can't you see?  
Can't you see, can't you see, can't you see?  
Can't you see, can't you see, can't you see?


When you feel down and you've nobody to turn to  
When you feel you're about to give up  
The sun goes down and darkness surrounds you  
And it's runnin' dry in your lovin' cup  
  
Cast the spirit, cast it out  
If it's in your body, then let it out  
Put out the fire, let it cool down  
If it's in your tears, then let it drown  
  
Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo  
Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo  
  
You can't ignore the feeling inside you  
In your mind you're without a friend  
The spirit is there, it's in every doorway  
You say to yourself, will it ever end  
  
Cast the spirit, cast it out  
If it's in your body, then let it out  
Put out the fire, let it cool down  
If it's in your tears, then let it drown  
  
Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo  
Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo  
  
When you feel down and have nobody to turn to  
You say to yourself, why can't it be  
The sun goes down and darkness surrounds you  
You feel you want to be free  
  
Cast the spirit, cast it out  
If it's in your body, then let it out  
Put out the fire, let it cool down  
If it's in your tears, then let it drown  
  
Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo  
Oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo, oo  
  
Cast the spirit  
Cast the spirit  
Cast the spirit ...


Well, I'm drivin' onward  
Through the pourin' rain  
There's a ticket waitin'  
I gotta catch that train  
The yellow racin' dreamboat  
On California air  
Single engine cowboy  
Out in county fair  
So, oh baby, hurry here to me  
Oh baby, come see me  
Oh baby, let the hours flee  
Oh baby, come see  
The silver clouds in August  
Lover's names on trees  
Imagine running water  
You wadin' in knee deep  
So, oh baby, hurry here to me  
Oh baby, come see me  
Oh baby, let the hours flee  
Oh baby, come see  
There's a world waitin'  
Just for you to unfold  
How are you to know  
If you don't see, if you don't see  
Those yellow racin' dreamboats  
On California air  
There's a ticket waitin'  
I guess I'll catch you there  
I guess I'll catch you there  
So, oh baby, hurry here to me  
Oh baby, come see me  
Oh baby, let the hours flee  
Oh baby, come see  
(If you don't come) Oh baby, hurry here to me  
Oh baby, come see me  
(If you don't come) Oh baby, let the hours flee  
Oh baby, come see  
(If you don't come) Oh baby, hurry here to me  
Oh baby, come see me  
(If you don't come) Oh baby, let the hours flee  
Oh baby, come see  
(If you don't come)  


Sat here thinking about my heart  
All of the places it came apart  
There's just one thing that I need to know  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it get it get it get it get it get it uh huh  
I ran through the meadow looking for a dream  
Truth is never like what it seems  
I guess there's always so far to go  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it get it uh huh  
Where is the light  
Where is the love  
Where are the dreams that I once had  
Frittered away  
Gone in the time it takes to get from there to here  
Get it get it get it  
Get it get it get it uh huh  
Get it get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
I'd draw you a picture cause it just might help  
To point out the place where we went so wrong  
The only color I'd use is blue  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it get it uh huh  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Why am I always chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it chasing the rainbow  
Get it get it get it uh huh  


The boy cried out  
Gaily on the ground  
At the joy  
Of something he had found  
  
Aw, come on children, get your heads back together  
Aw, come on children, get your heads back together  
Aw, come on children, get your heads back together  
  
The days are getting warmer now  
The nights are getting shorter now  
And you know we can make it 'cause you know we're alive  
But we don't have to take it, any way we'll survive  
  
If I were you  
I'd throw it far away  
But if you were me  
You'd tell me I should stay  
  
Aw, come on children, get your heads back together  
Aw, come on children, get your heads back together  
Aw, come on children, get your heads back together again  
  
Again, again and again and again  
Again, and again and again  
Again, again, again


Oh, look out kids it's that time of year  
When ole Santa's on his way  
Don't look now but the top is down  
On his candy apple sleigh  
  
Headin' on down the coast  
Over surf and sand  
The warm wind in his hair  
Make no mistake, it's here  
Holiday fun, good cheer  
It's Christmas time again  
In California, wo-oh  
  
The boulevard, lights of red and green  
As the snow birds make the scene  
Hollywood doesn't miss a beat  
It's another childhood dream  
  
Headin' on down the coast  
Over surf and sand  
The warm wind in your hair  
Make no mistake, it's here  
Holiday fun, good cheer  
It's Christmas time for sure  
In California  
  
People say it can't be true  
That the spirit lives here, too  
But you'll find Christmas everywhere  
Under palm trees, sun and moon - ah  
  
Headin' on down the coast  
Over surf and sand  
The warm wind in your hair  
Make no mistake, it's here  
Holiday fun, good cheer  
It's Christmas time again  
In California  
  
Make no mistake, it's here  
Holiday fun, good cheer  
It's Christmas time again  
In California  
In California  
In California, wo-oh


I was out last night having a ball  
And comin' home, I wasn't thinkin' nothin' at all  
And there on the sidewalk what did I see  
A little glass slipper starin' back at me  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
  
Well I'm not superstitious but I'm smarter than I seem  
And I knew it was love, if you know what I mean  
When I saw that slipper it occurred to me  
The shoe fit her and she fit me  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
  
When I find her it will be  
A fairy tale for her and me  
I will never let her go  
Cinderella  
  
Now the other girls hold no fascination for me  
I just think of her wherever she may be  
I will search my whole life through  
'Cause no one else will ever do  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
  
When I find her it will be  
A fairy tale for her and me  
I will never let her go  
She will give my heart a home  
Until that day I'll be alone  
With just a slipper and a dream  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
Cinderella (Cinderella)  
Oo (Cinderella)  
Cinderella (Cinderella)


Clarice lay down your mind, it's there just hard to find  
Follow me as we wind our way, away  
  
Behind an open door there lies a million more  
Follow me as we wind our way, away  
  
Time is coming soon I'll find you (Time is coming soon I'll find you)  
Time is coming soon I'll find you (Time is coming soon I'll find you)  
Time is coming soon, time is coming soon  
  
Behind an open door there lies a million more  
Follow me as we wind our way, away  
  
Time is coming soon I'll find you (Time is coming soon I'll find you)  
Time is coming soon I'll find you (Time is coming soon I'll find you)  
Time is coming soon, time is coming soon


Ah  
Lately, it hasn't been easy  
I've been wanderin' all night  
Searchin', tryin' to find an answer  
Why I'm in this situation  
I've been sailing close to the wind  
Trying to keep my head above water  
Close to the wind, without you  
I've been sailing close to the wind  
Everyday it just gets harder  
But you're all I need to survive  
For so long it felt like  
I was walking on the water  
I found the hard part  
Is waking without you in the morning  
I've been sailing close to the wind  
The weight of the world's on my shoulders (everyday now)  
Close to the wind, without you  
I've been sailing close to the wind  
The loneliness it's neverending (yes I'm falling)  
Open your heart, come aboard  
And if we're back together  
I know our love will be everlasting  
I still believe that there's a chance  
For us to have a happy ending  
Peace will reign on earth  
LIfe for all it's worth, oh yeah  
I pray every single morning  
That this time we will be much stronger  
I've been sailing close to the wind  
Help me try to find a shelter (to protect you)  
Close to the wind without you  
I've been sailing close to the wind  
But inside it's safe and warm now (we're together)  
Don't be afraid of the storm  
I've been sailing close, close to the wind (been sailing in)  
(Close to the wind) Don't be afraid of the storm  
I've been sailing close, close to the wind (been sailing in)  
(Close to the wind) Don't be afraid of the storm ...  


Some can see it's poetry  
Come as you are in your broken car  
The company  
Carousel is wishing well  
As a wonder night that spoke delight  
To the company  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Broken dream, just a token scheme  
Silver man with a telegram  
For the company  
Scalding blue, come talk to you  
Search the cave for the grave  
Of the company  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  
Can you hear the summer calling you  
Can you hear him call you now  


Secret calls long after hours  
Suspicions rise, why does she whisper  
Someone's hiding something  
What's going on  
She smiles and finds an excuse to go out  
Meets him somewhere on the edge of town  
For one more night of real love  
How can it be wrong  
'Cause when they turn out the lights  
In their rented room tonight  
Two lovers won't be lonely anymore  
When it's a desperate love, risk is high  
Cheating hearts making alibis  
In the shadows someone is waiting  
Waiting for their lover to come tonight  
A cheater's conscience has no pride  
To spend the night with another man's wife  
Lie to his best friend and never think twice  
He knows where to find what he longs to have  
And do anything 'cause he wants her that bad  
Love has many faces, faces to hide  
'Cause when they turn out the lights  
In their rented room tonight  
Two lovers won't be lonely anymore  
When it's a desperate love, risk is high  
Cheating hearts making alibis  
In the shadows someone is waiting  
Waiting for their lover to come tonight  
When it's a desperate love, risk is high  
Cheating hearts making alibis  
In the shadows someone is waiting  
Waiting for their lover to come tonight  
When it's a desperate love (desperate love), risk is high  
Cheating hearts making alibis  
In the shadows someone is waiting  
Waiting for their lover to come tonight  
When it's a desperate love (desperate love), risk is high  
Cheating hearts making alibis  
In the shadows someone is waiting  
Waiting for their lover to come tonight ...  


Starlight falling through your hair  
Sometimes I wonder if you know I'm there  
Awake in the morning a smile on your face  
The same old feeling that I just can't place  
And you say don't cry, baby  
You know I'll always be the one who cares  
Don't cry, baby  
Come closer let me wipe away your tears  
A man came in with a violin  
He played for me like I've never been  
Courted before and forevermore  
As the bow touched the strings  
He made the whole world sing  
Don't cry, baby (Baby, don't you cry)  
You know there'll always be someone who cares  
Don't cry, baby (Baby, don't you cry)  
Come closer let me wipe away your tears  
I know I've been wrong  
You've had to be strong  
I guess I belong to you, my baby (Baby, don't you cry)  
You know I'll always be the one who cares  
Don't cry baby (Baby, don't you cry)  
Come closer let me wipe away your tears  
The sound of your voice singing songs in the night  
Have taken me far away and mystified  
The songs of the lovers brought tears to my eyes  
The words that you'd spoken made me realize  


Written by dewey bunnell, (C)1976  
Found on hideaway.  
Somebody told me that the time was right  
To keep on ridin' and to hang on tight  
I heard the cry of a dog in the night  
But nobody told me it would be all right  
Don't let it get you down  
But nobody make a sound  
Don't let it get you down  
We took a ride down a hill that night  
The man was crazy but he wouldn't fight  
With bullets in his back and money in a sack  
We robbed a bank and we never looked back  
Don't let it get you down  
But nobody make a sound  
Don't let it get you down  
We took the bank, kept on runnin', but never too slow  
The ride was fun and you know we went to mexico  
But the action that felt all right  
Still haunts me in the night  
We took the bank, kept on runnin', but never too slow  
The ride was fun and you know we went to mexico  
But the action that felt all right  
Still haunts me in the night, alright  
Don't let it get you down  
'cause nobody made a sound  
Don't let it get you down  
They'll be lucky if we're ever found  
Don't let it get you down (don't let it get you down)  
Don't let it get you down (don't let it get you down)  
Don't let it get you down (don't let it get you down)  
Don't let it get you down (don't let it get you down) ...  


The waves come in  
Crash on the shoreline  
Salty water, don't you know  
It's yours, yours and mine  
So grab your girl  
And don't go wastin' time  
And let's go down to the water tonight  
  
White capped clouds  
Dance in the sunlight  
Purple fishes watch  
And show you some of their delight  
The weather's fine  
And everything's all right  
So let's go down to the water tonight  
Let's go down to the water tonight  
  
Come on down, come on down  
Come on down, down to the water  
Come on down, come on down  
Come on down, down to the water  
Down to the water  
  
Island music  
Sways with a palm tree  
Friends of mine lay back  
And talk of times that weren't so free  
So let's have fun  
And that means you and me  
And let's go down to the water tonight  
Let's go down to the water tonight  
  
Down, down, down to the water  
Down, down, down to the water  
Down, down, down to the water  
Down, down, down to the water  
Down, down, down to the water  
Down, down, down to the water...


I stayed up all night long  
Drinkin' and thinkin' 'bout you  
Is there anything left at all  
Is there anything that I can do  
'Cause I don't know what to say anymore  
I don't know how to even the score with you, with you  
Starin' hard at that big front door  
Is it time now to find my shoes  
It ain't the loss of love no more  
I'm just tryin' hard to live with you  
'Cause I don't know what to say anymore  
And I don't know how to even the score with you, with you  
With you, with you  
'Cause I don't know what to say anymore  
And I don't know how to even the score with you, oh, with you  
Is love a question, who's weak, who's strong  
I can't see it, where's a compromise  
It's so confusin' where this thing has gone  
It's gotta stop, you've gotta realize  
'Cause I don't know what to say anymore  
And I don't know how to even the score with you, oh, with you  
Yes, with you, oh, with you  
'Cause I don't know what to say anymore  
And I don't know how to even the score with you, oh, with you  
Yes, with you, oh, with you  
I don't know what to say anymore  
And I don't know how to even the score with you, oh, with you  
Yes, with you, oh, with you  


You let me follow you around  
It helped your status in the town  
Well I didn't know your name  
There's no truth in what you claim  
So I think you better stop this foolin' 'round  
I think it's called a lesson learned  
When one so close suddenly turns  
Leaves you standing on your own  
Got no place to call your home  
So I think you better stop this foolin' 'round  
Now it's my time to make amends  
Hope my message don't offend  
And I hope this doesn't drive you round the bend  
Leaves you standing on your own  
Got no place to call your home  
So I think you better stop this foolin' 'round  
Yes, I think you better stop this foolin' 'round  
Yes, I think you better stop this foolin' 'round  
(Repeat and fade)  


I look inside at the scarlet room  
Places to hide in the dusty gloom  
A noisy clock and a silver spoon  
A china cup on the mantlepiece  
Gathering dust as it did in the east  
And just outside lies the garden of peace  
Oh, tell me is this really true  
Can it be, peace has come to me and you  
Tell me over, over and over  
Tell me is this really happening  
Inside this world it's beautiful  
Peace in this garden has come true  
A mirror pond reflects the dawn  
Over the banks, 'cross the emerald lawn  
A breeze has come and I'm carried along  
So follow the path through the knowing trees  
And each time you laugh, it is love you release  
That love will come back in the garden of peace  
So, tell me is this really true  
Can it be, peace has come to me and you  
Tell me over, over and over  
Tell me is this really happening  
Inside this world it's beautiful  
Peace in the garden has come true  
Oh, tell me is this really true  
Can it be, peace has come to me and you  
Tell me over, over and over  
Tell me is this really happening  
Inside this world it's beautiful  
Peace in the garden has come true ...  


Bells ring in in my ear  
Voices I hear  
Whispering daily to me  
Love in your fire  
High on a wire  
When I know you're near me  
God, I'm glad to see you  
I thought you'd left me far away  
I wouldn't give much to be you  
But I want you to know I feel this way  
All over the world  
Flags are being unfurled  
Waving before the dawning  
I'm watching the show  
The last one to know  
Which way that things are going  
God, I'm glad to know you  
I thought you'd left me far away  
I wouldn't give much to be you  
But I want you to know I feel this way  
Cars fighting their way  
Out of L.A.  
On a Sunday morning  
I'm watching the show  
The last one to know  
Which way that things are going  
God, I'm glad to see you  
I thought you'd left me far away  
I wouldn't give much to be you  
But I want you to know I feel this way  
God, I'm glad to know you  


God of the sun  
Don't make me wait till the morning comes  
Light in the sky  
Look me in the eye, eye, eye, eye  
  
Don't, keep me waiting around  
Too much longer now  
Don't, don't keep me waiting around, around, around, around  
  
When I called you from my river of darkness  
An echo was all that came back  
Saw you wave goodbye  
Down the railroad track  
Sometimes when you're out and all alone  
And you can't find your way back  
Wonder if you'll ever make it home  
  
God of the sun  
I'll be around till the day's begun  
One sight of your ray  
Takes the night away, away, away, away  
  
Oh, but when I walk through that door  
Take my hat and my coat off waiting for you to call  
I tell you not right now, lady, I got work on my mind  
And I'll talk to you soon  
Always remember  
  
When I called you from my river of darkness  
An echo was all that came back  
I saw you wave goodbye  
Down the railroad track  
Sometimes when you're out and all alone  
And you can't find your way back  
Wonder if we'll ever make it home  
No more


Watchin' a stretch of road  
Miles of light explode  
Driftin' off a thing  
I'd never done before  
  
Watchin' the crowd roll in  
Out go the lights, it begins  
A feelin' in my bones  
I never felt before  
  
People always told me  
That bars are dark and lonely  
And talk is often cheap  
And filled with air  
  
Sure sometimes they thrill me  
But nothin' could ever chill me  
Like the way they make  
The time just disappear  
  
Feelin' you here again  
Hot on my skin again  
Feelin' good, a thing  
I'd never known before  
  
What does it mean to feel  
Millions of dreams come real?  
A feelin' in my soul  
I'd never felt before  
  
And you, you always told me  
No matter how long it holds me  
If it falls apart  
Or makes us millionaires  
  
You'll be right here forever  
We'll go through this thing together  
And on Heaven's golden shore  
We'll lay our heads


Goodbye, Mrs. Sorrow  
Hope you're feeling better tomorrow night  
Don't put up a fight  
It'll do you no good  
Hello, Uncle Freedom  
I've seen them down on their knees for you  
Nothing they wouldn't do  
To have you along  
I got too many problems  
They just don't understand  
They think their every wish  
Is my command  
Oh no, Sister Susie  
You're in a win or lose affair  
Wish I could be there  
To help you along  
Oh yes, Brother Michael  
We all have every faith in you  
And everything you do  
All the way round  
I got too many problems  
They just don't understand  
They think their every wish  
Is my command  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye  
Goodbye, goodbye  


In this world of lost horizons  
Where your dreams burn fast  
But your nights go slower  
Ever find that you're compromising  
All your hopes and fears  
Just to get to know her  
  
So you take a walk down the goodbye highway  
The hello goodbye way  
It's a long long road  
Ever take a stroll down the goodbye highway  
The some other time way  
Try to ease your load  
  
She was never one for social graces  
And hangin' out with the midnight faces  
Wore me out  
I guess the thoughts of the nights alone  
Or the time waiting for the telephone  
Removed the doubt  
  
So we took a ride down the goodbye highway  
The hello goodbye way  
It's the longest road  
Soon you're fighting over the yours or my way  
The do or die way's  
The only way you know  
  
So you stand up for the things that you're losing  
Out on but it's all so confusing  
You hold on but it slips right through your hands  
Guess it's so long with a change of direction  
Goodbye gotta make my connection  
Solo, as you head on out the door, forever more  
  
So you take a walk down the goodbye highway  
The hello goodbye way  
It's a one way road  
Ever find yourself down the goodbye highway  
The some other time way  
Nowhere left to go, nowhere left to go


Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on our troubles will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas  
Make the Yuletide gay  
From now on our troubles will be miles away  
  
Here were are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a Merry Little Christmas now  
  
Here were are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a Merry Little Christmas now


I am thinkin' 'bout the days  
We led ourselves astray  
In more than many ways  
Here, within the time we've spent  
Wonderin' what we meant  
By livin' all those years  
By livin' all those years  
  
We are here with nothing to do today  
It's something we can't explain  
And tomorrow, where will we be tomorrow?  
What will we see today?  
  
I am thinkin' 'bout the days  
We led ourselves astray  
In more than many ways  
(Here) Here, within the time we've spent  
Wonderin' what we meant  
By livin' all those years  
(Here) By livin' all those years  
(Here) By livin' all those years  
(Here) By livin' all those years  
(Here) By livin' all those years  
(Here, here, here)


Now I'm high in the city  
Feel the evening air  
The crowds in the city  
Compete for a share  
It's all so busy, a complete affair  
Down here...  
As I walk through marble  
Finding my way out to daylight  
One drinking orange vodka  
Someone inside here  
Will give us a ride dear  
I know a place where we both can go  
To set our hearts on fire  
I know the city's the only show  
Can I take you for a ride  
I can make you satisfied  
All 'n all it's worth your while  
Change that frown back to a smile  
Tonight  
Do or die in the misty city  
All night long  
A nightclub in the middle  
Tappin' time to my song  
Catch hell for leavin'  
They are always wrong  
Down here...  
As I walk through marble  
Finding my way in the night-light  
Two people sit and argue  
Someone inside here  
Will give them a ride clear  
I know a place where we both can go  
To set our hearts on fire  
I know the city's the only show  
Can I take you for a ride  
I can make you satisfied  
All 'n all it's worth your while  
Change that frown back to a smile  
Tonight  


There's a clock timing the world as it turns  
There's a man marking the candle as it burns  
Keeping track of every minute that remains  
Still we hope somehow  
It's gonna be alright  
It's gonna turn out fine  
There's a light shining beyond the southern cross  
Burning bright for everyone of us who's lost  
More than faith more than a reason to go on  
Rise on up knowing  
You're gonna win the fight  
It's gonna turn out fine  
You gotta hope it'll be alright  
Come on and hope it'll turn out fine  
Yeah, hope it'll be alright, please  
When the night turns to the deepest shade of black  
At that point there is no reason to turn back  
High above angels are falling from the sky  
Lift your heart knowing  
It's gonna be alright  
It's gonna turn out fine  
You gotta hope it'll be alright  
Come on and hope it'll turn out fine  
Yeah, hope it'll be alright, please  
You gotta hope, ya gonna win the fight  
Come on 'n hope with all your might  
Yeah hope it's gonna be alright, please  
Millions of people alone in the dark  
Awaiting a moment of hope  
Please  
You gotta hope (Whenever times get tough) it'll be alright  
Come on and hope (And when the road is rough) it'll turn out fine  
Yeah, hope (Just when you've had enough) it'll be alright, please  
You gotta hope (Whenever times get tough) you're gonna win the fight  
Come on and hope (And when the road is rough) with all your might  
Yeah, hope (Just when you've had enough) it's gonna be alright, please  
You gotta hope (Whenever times get tough) it'll be alright  
Come on and hope (And when the road is rough) it'll turn out fine  
Yeah, hope (Just when you've had enough) it'll be alright, please  
You gotta hope, you're gonna win the fight  


All you brothers and sisters  
Lookin' for a better way  
Why don't you all go to the country  
Hitch a ride from the city  
Get away for the day  
The summertime is gonna take you  
People playing music won't forsake you  
But when it's hot  
You gotta go all the way  
All you dancers and twisters  
Lookin' for a place to play  
Why don't you all go to the country  
People in the city  
Get away for the day  
I don't know how I'm gonna do it  
But someone else will push me to it  
But when it's hot  
You gotta go all the way  
The summertime is gonna take you  
People playing music won't forsake you  
I don't know how I'm gonna do it  
But someone else will push me to it  


In the sea the fish have learned to fly  
On a moonlit night on wings of silver  
As the enchanted stars sail serenely by  
Do they know where do unicorns go  
Where winged horses fly  
Narwhales lost at sea and never seen again  
Go, go and ask the magpie  
Where do unicorns go  
  
In the trees the birds have learned to speak  
Gaily colored they keep their secrets  
In a parade of clouds playing hide and seek  
Do they know where do unicorns go  
Where winged horses fly  
Narwhales lost at sea and never seen again  
Does myth and mystery lie  
Where the unicorns go

And it don't look as though they'll last  
Till judgement day  
  
We'll make them see internationl  
We'll make them be international  
Like you and me  
  
International, international, international, international  
International, international, international, international


Jet Boy Blue  
You steal and you think that it's right  
Like a thief in the night  
Ah, oh yeah  
I'll tell you it's true  
You come around with your stories to tell  
I don't hold no interest  
But I let you go  
I know you've fallen under his spell  
Don't let him kill you  
He'll only fill you with lies  
You're a fool and you know it  
Done your best not to show it  
But it's all over  
You're through  
Jet Boy Blue  
He'll only take you for a ride  
Only cost you your pride  
Jet Boy Blue  
  
[Chorus]  
Stop, stop while you're still ahead  
You've got a lot to learn  
You're still so young  
Listen to what your mama said  
  
Try to tell you go to hell  
You're just a kid  
Don't take no advice, you never think twice  
Close the door  
Jump in, don't mention what you did  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're a fool and you know it  
Done your best not to show it  
But it's all over  
You're through  
Jet Boy Blue  
He'll only take you for a ride  
Only cost you your pride  
Jet Boy Blue  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Jet Boy Blue  
You steal and you think that it's right  
Like a thief in the night  
  
Woah, Jet, Jet, Jet, Jet Boy Blue  
Jet Boy Blue [Repeat: x7]


Oh, the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since we've no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
It doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I brought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
When we finally kiss good night  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
The fire is slowly dying  
And my dear, we're still goodbyeing  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Let it snow  
Oh, fire is slowly dying  
And my dear, we're still goodbyeing  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
When we finally kiss good night  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
The fire is slowly dying  
And my dear, we're still goodbyeing  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  


You have one letter left to send  
With no beginning and no end  
You saw them in the park  
The laughter in the dark, oh no  
How can you face him and pretend  
  
So now you thank him carefully, oh no  
'Cause that's the way he's going to be, oh no  
I hope you find some reason to be free  
  
There is no sunshine in your eyes  
You make no sound and yet you cry  
It's not the double cross  
You feel the love you lost, oh no  
This letter has to say goodbye  
  
So now you thank him carefully, oh no  
'Cause that's the way he's going to be, oh no  
I hope you find some reason to be free  
  
You saw them in the park  
The laughter in the dark, oh no  
How can you face him and pretend  
  
So now you thank him carefully, oh no  
'Cause that's the way he's going to be, oh no  
I hope you find some reason to be free


This is for all the lonely people  
Thinking that life has passed them by  
Don't give up  
Until you drink from the silver cup  
And ride that highway in the sky  
  
This is for all the single people  
Thinking that life has left them dry  
Don't give up  
Until you drink from the silver cup  
You never know until you try  
  
Well, I'm on my way  
Yes, I'm back to stay  
Well, I'm on my way back home  
  
This is for all the lonely people  
Thinking that life has passed them by  
Don't give up  
Until you drink from the silver cup  
She'll never take you down or  
Never give you up  
You'll never know until you try


Like you said, you'd never get used to it  
But it's lost that old surprise  
Time comes and goes so quiet now  
Leaves emptiness behind our eyes  
Oh, darling, if I could spare us  
From an hour of the pain  
Like you said, you'd never get used to it  
But love's worn out again  
Winter's here, bring the blankets out  
To cover up the cold  
I'm dreamin' of the good night's sleep  
Like I used to know in days of old  
You told me you felt all alone  
But you did not tell me when  
Like you said, you'd never get used to it  
But love's worn out again  
Love's worn out again, darling  
It's moved around the bend, darling  
There's no telling when  
We'll feel it again  
Oh, maybe I can't see what's plainly in my view  
Oh, I wish I was a better man, maybe it's just you  
But there's something goin' on here  
Like a wound that will not mend  
Like you said, you'd never get used to it  
But love's worn out again  
Love's worn out again, darling  
It's moved around the bend, darling  
There's no telling when  
We'll feel it again  
Love's worn out again, darling  
It's moved around the bend, darling  
There's no telling when  
We'll feel it again  
Love's worn out again, darling  
It's moved around the bend, darling  
There's no telling when  
We'll feel it again ...  


Through the darkness I see you again  
Watch my temperature rise  
Can't believe my eyes, don't tell me  
I've had way too much tonight  
  
Drank the potion stronger than me  
Got me all confused  
Why you so amused, don't tell me  
You've had way too much tonight  
  
Please don't tell me no  
God, I miss you so  
One thing you should know  
God, I love you so, oh  
  
Had way too much tonight  
I'm a mad dog at times like these  
Don't know where to turn  
Ain't the time to learn my lesson  
I've had way too much tonight  
  
Ain't the time to learn my lesson  
I've had way too much to-  
Really too much to-  
I've had way too much tonight  
Alright  
  
I've had way too much to-  
Really too much to-  
I've had way too much tonight


The moon begins to rise upon my fallen eyes  
I'm taken back to firelight  
A drunken dreamer's plan to stay just as I am  
Amidst the dancing paradise  
A case of beer, a smile, a motorcycle child  
I feel the glow surround me  
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you  
  
Orange funnels and snowy tunnels  
Summer troubles and books in bundles  
Orange funnels and snowy tunnels  
And you, and you, and you, and you, and you


Here in the dawn  
As I walk through this dream  
As I have done since ages now gone  
Shall I read you the letter  
They sent postmarked from somewhere out here  
It's in Latin, I think, I don't know  
Can you help me, my dear  
Please, can you help me, my dear  
Near to their bed (they never sleep)  
They sit sipping their tea, watch the sea  
Move the sand through their heads (sit in their chairs by the bay)  
Did I show you the marks on the wall  
Left by captains now dead (house out on the cove)  
They fell fighting for peace in their lives  
Or so it is said (still nobody seems to be here)  
Please, can you help me, my dear  
Please, can you help me, my dear  
You can't miss it  
A blue forest on a green sky  
You must risk it  
Don't ignore us if you want us to  
If we want us to survive  
Where will I be (can't you help me to find my way)  
After watching them walking the pier  
At the mouth of the sea (I've been lost for so long)  
They're in love with the news  
And don't show if they're living in fear (still nobody seems to be here)  
They eat ice cream alone  
Watch the waves at the end of the pier (ah, nobody seems to hear)  
Please, can you help me, my dear  
Please, can you help me, my dear  


Written by russ ballard, (C)1983  
Found on your move and the very best of america.  
  
I've been in love, girl, so many times before  
They'd love me and leave me, i thought i knew the score  
I'd fall in love no more  
I was walking in shadows then, my life a lonely road  
I was walking to nowhere, with a heavy loaded heart  
To laugh i played the part  
  
(do, do, do ... ) then came that magic day  
I saw you as you walked my way  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Yeah, you're my kinda woman  
And i can't help but tell you that you are (you are)  
Yes, you know you are  
Girl, you know you are (yes you are, you know you are, you know you are)  
  
The longer together then, the more we fell in love  
No makin' or breakin' up, now i know i found real love  
And i can't get enough (oo, i love you, i really love you)  
So good to be winnin' now, i never thought i'd do  
You got me spinnin', honey it's all down to you  
You're there to see me through (oo, i love you, i really love you, yes i love
you)  
  
(do, do, do ... ) and from just one kiss  
Who would believe that it would be like this  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Yeah, you're my kinda woman  
And i can't help but tell you that you are (you are)  
Yes, you know you are  
Girl, you know you are (yes you are, you know you are, you know you are)  
  
My kinda woman i know that this is really love  
There'll be no breakin' up, oh no  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Here she comes, my kinda woman  
Yeah, you're my kinda woman  
And i can't help but tell you that you are (you are)  
Yes, you know you are  
Girl, you know you are (yes you are, you know you are)  
Oh, yes you are


Got you by my side,  
I'll never be lonely.  
Got you by my side,  
I'll never be afraid.  
Never be lonely anymore.  
Turn away the fools from my door.  
Always want to be your one and only.  
Never be lonely.  
  
Spent a lot of time,  
Waitin' to find you.  
Spent a lot of time,  
All on my own.  
Could've gone a thousand different ways,  
Watching my nights turn to days.  
Always want to be your one and only.  
Never be lonely.  
  
Here in the middle of now or never,  
Finally found where I belong.  
I could go on like this forever,  
Looking at you, looking at you.  
  
Wasn't I the one,  
Love never came to?  
Wasn't I the one,  
So misunderstood?  
All because my heart wasn't sure.  
Never felt a love like this before.  
Always want to be your one and only.  
Never be lonely.  
  
Here in the middle of now or never,  
Finally found where I belong.  
I could go on like this forever,  
Looking at you, looking at you.  
  
Got me by your side,  
Never be lonely.  
Got me by your side,  
Never be afraid.  
And I will not let you down.  
Keeping both feet on the ground.  
Always want to be your one and only.  
Never be lonely.  
  
Never be lonely.  
Never be lonely.  
Never be lonely.  
Never be lonely.  
Never be lonely.


I never found the time  
To see things quite through  
I never found the time  
To give them to you  
  
If living don't come easy  
Don't stop your own voice  
Cause the worst part of living  
Is havin' no choice  
  
Tell me a story  
Tell it with your eyes  
I'm gonna stop believin'  
If I hear another lie  
Drink some cold water  
Your mouth's getting dry  
  
If I only had the time  
To see things right through  
I'd give up all my treasures  
And send them to you  
  
Then livin' would seem easy  
No lights and no noise  
Just me and my lady  
And the echo of her voice  
  
Tell me a story  
Tell it with your eyes  
I'm gonna stop believin'  
If I hear another lie  
Drink some cold water  
Your mouth's getting dry  
  
I never found the time  
To see into my lady  
And memories don't die  
But with time become hazy  
  
I never found the time  
To see into my lady  
And memories don't die  
But with time become hazy  
  
I never found the time  
To see into my lady  
And memories don't die  
But with time become hazy  
  
I never found the time


We were dancin' in the middle  
We could hardly hold our heads up  
I think we had too much to drink  
I remember wondering what they'd think  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
We were thinkin' 'bout the future  
We were trying not to laugh  
Then you made me cry instead  
I remember wishing I was dead  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
No fortune pays for wounds like these  
It's been too long a time now please  
Just say you will, we can call it a day  
It's not as though we ain't sinned  
It's just a game we all play  
There was nothing to win  
Well I'm coming home lady  
I'm your homecoming man  
Trying hard to stand the rain  
Gettin' back on my feet again  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
No fortune pays for wounds like these  
It's been too long a time now please  
Just say you will, we can call it a day  
It's not as though we ain't sinned  
It's just a game we all play  
There was nothing to win  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
No fortune pays for wounds like these  
It's been too long a time now please  
Just say you will, we can call it a day  
It's not as though we ain't sinned  
It's just a game we all play  
There was nothing to win  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  
Da, da, da, da, da, da, da  


Hey, honey, won't you sit down  
And stop here for a spell  
Singin' the sweet old lullabies  
To forget about your health  
Don't think about tomorrow  
It's a whole night's sleep away  
Sure would be pleased to have you stay  
And it's reach out old Virginia  
Won't you rock him close to you  
The poor boy's had a hotel so long  
He don't know what to do  
It's time to come on home  
And put your feet up for a while  
So much travlin' 'round tends to take away your smile  
'Pears to me it's all a body can do to stay in tune  
And you've been strainin' at those strings  
From mornin' till noon  
So come on down and hang around  
It'll put you right real soon  
'Cause nothing's changed  
It's all the same  
Reach out old Virginia  
Won't you rock him close to you  
The poor boy's had a hotel so long  
He don't know what to do  
It's time to come on home  
And put your feet up for a while  
So much travlin' 'round can take away your smile  
Reach out old Virginia  
Won't you rock him close to you  
The poor boy's had a hotel so long  
He don't know what to do  
It's time to come on home  
And put your feet up for a while  
So much travlin' 'round can take away your smile  


Lala Salama  
To the Masai Mara  
And asante sana  
Kichwa Tembo  
I'm going Oloololo  
Back to the world where I'm from  
Soon I'll be flying solo  
On a heading that follows the sun  
Oloololo, Oloololo, 'loololo  
'Cause I've been down from Nairobi  
Southeast of Kisumu  
To the waiting savanna  
Like a place that I once knew  
And the river was flowing  
While the crocodile baked in the sun  
With the elephant knowing  
That a change had already begun  
Oloololo, Oloololo, 'loololo  
Oloololo, Oloololo  
(Lala Salama) Oloololo (To the Masai Mara)  
(And asante sana) Oloololo (To Kichwa Tembo)  
  


One morning when the mist came down  
I woke up early and I looked around  
My baby slept, the sky was blue  
I started walkin' thinkin' only of you  
Up the hill and down the road  
Past the people that I barely know  
Round the bend to the run-off wash  
I found a feather that a quail had lost  
Where are you goin' now my friend  
Where are you goin' now  
Are you going to see them on the mountain now  
Goin' to see them trees  
Goin' to watch the circles take a bow  
Goin' to help agree  
To be  
Today  
Some people like to play out loud  
I like them always, they're a laughing crowd  
To catch the wind then come slidin' down  
You reach the bottom fallin' upside down  
Touch a hand and see the world turnin' circles  
Brushin' every curl back again  
To those sunset walks  
That special summer and those all night talks  


Give me all your money, any time I ask  
Desperate situation, rally to the task  
Playing God, shine in all his glory  
Playing God  
Warm you till you can sleep at night  
  
Somewhere in your memory  
Lies the dormant seed  
Pacify your guilt now, and satisfy my greed  
Playing God, climb the golden ladder  
Playing God  
Warm you up so you'll sleep at night  
  
Between the ether and the opium lies the land of no regret  
Of what we are and what we might become  
Are we walking on the water yet?  
  
Playing God, shine in all his glory  
Playing God, warm you up so you'll sleep at night  
Playing God, climb the golden ladder  
Playing God  
  
Playing God, shine in all his glory  
Playing God, warm you up so you'll sleep at night  
Playing God


I can't help thinkin' as those ships sail away  
What sirens beckon and call  
How long at sea this time how long between  
The ports-of-call, ports-of-call  
Under the bridge they move to far off lands  
Maybe Australia or North African sands  
Complete the mission, supply and demand  
To ports-of-call, ports-of-call  
And everyday as the sun is setting  
Along the bay city lights appear  
Snake charmers sway while the smoke is rising  
Time is growing near  
When they'll be casting off anchor as they sail away  
Into the morning light  
Rising and falling through the blue and gray  
To ports-of-call, ports-of-call  
And everyday as the sun is setting  
Along the bay city lights appear  
Snake charmers sway while the smoke is rising  
Time is growing near  
And everyday as the sun is setting  
Along the bay city lights appear  
Snake charmers sway while the smoke is rising  
Time is growing near  
I'll take the chance this time to change my world (change my world)  
And break those ties that bind (ties that bind)  
Far from those people passing through my life  
Like ports-of-call, ports-of-call  
Under the bridge I'll move to far off lands (far off lands)  
Maybe Australia or North African sands (North African sands)  
Complete my mission, hope you understand  
Ports-of-call, ports-of-call  
Ports-of-call, ports-of-call  
Ports-of-call, ports-of-call ...  


Living on the riverside taking it all in my stride  
Living on the riverside, I'm taking life like a big long ride  
You stay on your side and I'll stay on mine  
You take what you want and I'll take the sunshine  
  
Dit dit dit dit do  
Ah, ah  
  
I said the world don't owe me no living  
I said the world don't owe me no living  
I said the world don't owe me no living  
I said the world don't owe me no living


One more song about movin' along the highway  
Feel the fantasy in the air  
  
(Ah -- --)  
  
Filled the room with flowers from Norway  
Sensed her majesty in the air  
Made a sign 'bove your doorway, to show I care  
  
I've been waiting every morning  
Just to help you find your way  
I've been standing on your corner  
(Don't go away) Don't go away  
  
One more song about movin' along the highway  
Feel the fantasy in the air  
  
I've been waiting every morning  
Just to help you find your way  
I've been waiting every morning  
Help me make it through the day  
  
I've been waiting every morning  
Just to help you find your way  
I've been waiting every morning  
Help me make it through the day  
  
I've been waiting every morning ...


First came the winter  
And then came the morning  
Bright coral branches that pass you again  
Down from the meadow and onto the seashore  
Came the vast checkerboard kingdom of men  
Sun radiates gold infrarays  
Time to prepare for the fall  
Harvest the corn, watch for the storm  
Soon we will hear winter call  
Ice on the pond, won't stay too long  
Too thin to walk it today  
Ice on the pond, something went wrong  
Frost must be lost on the way  
Evening is falling  
The tree is a silhouette  
As seen by the teddy bear  
Watching his den  
Spring came so quickly  
That I did not see her  
Just turn around  
And she's coming again  
Wind chimes along, rising at dawn  
Seasons in circles too match  
Each comes along, singing his song  
Burying thoughts of the past  


Caroline is falling in and out of love  
Try'n' to get those things that she's been thinkin' of  
She can't be what she wants to be  
Though she never really tries  
She's a liar  
She's a liar  
But I might try her tonight  
And if things go right  
Caroline is calling everyone in town  
First she calls them friends and then she puts them down  
She can't be what she wants to be  
Though she never really tries  
She's a liar  
She's a liar  
But I might try her tonight  
And if things go right  
She can't be what she wants to be  
Though she never really tries  
She's a liar  
She's a liar  
But I might try her tonight  
And if things go right  
Wo, she's a liar (She's a liar)  
She's a liar (She's a liar)  
She's a liar (She's a liar)  
She's a liar (She's a liar)  
She's a liar (She's a liar)  


We're afraid she's gonna let you down  
Take your money and drop you to the ground  
Wouldn't want to see you messed around  
After all the love you think you've found  
She's gonna let you down  
  
Doesn't matter what we say  
Love's the stubbornest game to play  
Given time you might see it our way  
And we'll be sorry boy until that day  
She's gonna break away  
  
Remember all the times you helped us through  
Now here's our chance to do the same for you  
Guess the thing to do is wait around  
Lend a hand when you are on the ground  
She's gonna let you down  
She's gonna let you down  
She's gonna let you down


Life today is frittered away  
You've got to simplify  
Each in our own way, we live for today  
And never know why  
  
To stand in the road  
And feel the wind blow  
Across the sands of time  
'cause that's the simple life  
You know I'd like to make it mine  
  
Take your cars and your bars  
And trade 'em all in for a nice wood fire  
At the end of the day I know you will say  
You couldn't get much higher  
  
To stand in the road  
And feel the wind blow  
Across the sands of time  
'cause that's the simple life  
You know I'd like to make it mine  
  
To stand in the road  
And feel the wind blow  
Across the sands of time  
'cause that's the simple life  
You know I'd like to make it mine  
You know I'd like to make it mine  
You know I'd like to make it mine


Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling too  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, yoo-hoo  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, let's go, let's look at the show  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow  
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, it's grand, just holding your hand  
We're gliding along with a song of a wintry fairyland  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy-cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be  
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
  
There's a birthday party at the home of farmer Gray  
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day  
We'll be singing the songs, we love to sing without a single stop  
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop, pop, pop, pop  
  
There's a happy feeling, nothing in the world can buy  
When you pass around the cider and the pumpkin pie  
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives  
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives  
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives  
  
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling too  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
Outside the snow is falling and friends are calling, yoo-hoo  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, let's go, let's look at the show  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow

For a sleigh ride together with you, sleigh ride together with you  
Sleigh ride together with you


I hear you knockin' but you can't come in  
You wear your stockings like you think it's a sin  
Don't try to tell me you ain't been where you been  
'Cause I know that you've been messin' round with him  
So slow down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Come on down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Oh down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Before it gets too late  
Before it gets too late  
I met you dancin' at the high school gym  
You rubbed against me my head started to spin  
You turned around gave me a wink and a grin  
And then you told me that you'd like to be friends  
Don't slow down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Don't slow down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Don't slow down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Don't slow down  
Before it gets too late  
Before it gets too late  
Take it!  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
On down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
On down  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Don't try to tell me  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
You'll never sell me  
(Bop shoo wop, you'd better slow down)  
Before it gets too late  
I said before it gets too late  
You know before it gets too late  
Oh, hey  


Sometimes there are teardrops across your face  
Sometimes there are rainbows in the same place  
And I don't know which way to turn  
Sometimes lovers don't act like they should  
And sometimes lovers don't do all they could  
Sometimes lovers hide in the cover  
Of innocence and blame  
I know sometimes we act just the same  
Your heart's in the city, it wears me down  
No love, no pity, in this town  
And I don't know which way to turn  
Sometimes lovers don't act like they should  
And sometimes lovers don't do all they could  
Sometimes lovers hide in the cover  
Of innocence and blame  
I know baby  
Hold on tight to me mama  
Tell me what went wrong  
I'm alright I will lay beside you  
Till the night is gone  
Ah, oo ...  
Sometimes lovers don't act like they should  
And sometimes lovers don't do all they could  
Sometimes lovers hide in the cover  
Of innocence and blame  
Sometimes lovers don't act like they should  
Sometimes lovers don't do all they could  
Sometimes lovers hide in the cover  
Of innocence and blame  


Why do you laugh at me when you know I really care  
You sometimes act as though I'm not even there  
And yet if you did to me the things I do to you  
I would surely say we're through  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't you know that I love you  
I was hoping you'd love me, too  
Don't you know that I love you, love you  
  
If I seem to you indifferent once or twice  
It's because I was feelin' quite that way  
And the time I hung up the phone and didn't speak again  
Well, it's funny to look back then  
  
Didn't I love you (Love you)  
Didn't I love you all the time  
Didn't you need me (Need me)  
Wasn't it a long, hard climb  
  
[Chorus]


Well, I'm running down the road  
Tryin' to loosen my load  
I've got seven women on  
My mind,  
Four that wanna own me,  
Two that wanna stone me,  
One says she's a friend of mine  
Take it easy, take it easy  
Don't let the sound of your own wheels  
Drive you crazy  
Lighten up while you still can  
Don't even try to understand  
Just find a place to make your stand  
And take it easy  
Well, I'm a standing on a corner  
In winslow, arizona  
And such a fine sight to see  
It's a girl, my lord, in a flatbed  
Ford slowin' down to take a look at me  
Come on, baby, don't say maybe  
I gotta know if your sweet love is  
Gonna save me  
We may lose and we may win though  
We will never be here again  
So open up, I'm climbin' in,  
So take it easy  
Well I'm running down the road trying to loosen  
My load, got a world of trouble on my mind  
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my  
Cover, she's so hard to find  
Take it easy, take it easy  
Don't let the sound of your own  
Wheels make you crazy  
Come on baby, don't say maybe  
I gotta know if your sweet love is  
Gonna save me, oh oh oh  
Oh we got it easy  
We oughta take it easy


You must be lost in a faraway land  
I searched forever your footprints in the sand  
I feel you need me, I have to answer  
That desperate call that I do not understand  
  
A burning bridge, a lonely highway  
Another dark night thinking alone  
What could've happened, am I just dreaming  
It doesn't matter but there's one thing that I know  
  
If I could make it to the border  
If I could make it to the coast  
If I could make it to the border  
I'd be in the arms of the girl I love the most  
  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
  
So on and on I keep on running  
To make the border before the light  
Just one more river, then I can make it  
Again you'll be in my arms tonight  
  
If I could make it to the border  
If I could make it to the coast  
If I could make it to the border  
I'd be in the arms of the girl I love the most  
  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
  
If I could make it to the border  
If I could make it to the coast  
If I could make it to the border  
I'd be in the arms of the girl I love the most  
  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Make it to the border ...


These brown eyes of mine  
They've been doin' some powerful cryin'  
Thinkin' 'bout all those years  
That always bring back the tears  
  
Winter's come and gone  
And I've been left alone  
Now I'm here home with you (I'm here home with you)  
I do all the things that you do  
  
Then I stop and I look around  
I never know if my feet touch the ground  
But oh, baby, I know you're right  
  
Seems like a long, long time  
Since I've held you in these arms of mine  
Thinkin' 'bout all those years (Thinkin' 'bout all those years)  
That always bring back the tears  
  
The winter's come and gone  
And I've been left all alone  
But, oh, baby, I know you're right  
  
And now that you're far away  
I think of your love  
And I'm praying that you're still mine  
  
These brown eyes of mine  
They've been doin' some powerful cryin'  
Thinkin' 'bout all those years (Thinkin' 'bout all those years)  
That always bring back the tears  
  
Then I stop and I look around  
I never know if my feet touch the ground  
But oh, baby, I know you're right  
Baby, I know you're right  
Baby, I know you're right


Hold me close  
You turn nighttime into day  
And you're the most  
Brightest star that lights my way  
  
[Chorus]  
So come home to me now  
Cause it won't matter anyhow  
I've got this feeling that today's the day  
I've got this feeling today's the day  
  
Turn me out  
Turn me out on this fine day  
'Cause all about  
All the people like to play  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've got this feeling that today's the day  
I've got this feeling today's the day  
  
Hold me close  
You turn nighttime into day  
And you're the most  
Brightest star that lights my way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've got this feeling that today's the day  
I've got this feeling today's the day [Repeat: x3]


Touched by a butterfly on my way home  
Flying who knows where  
Walking down that dusty road  
Without a care  
The sun was shining up in the country  
And bells were ringing downtown  
Clouds were moving slow and lazy  
While I was kicking around  
And feeling out the town and the country  
Feeling out the town and the country  
Up on the hill I got a better look  
I watched the river run brown (watched the river run brown)  
And then I heard those songbirds singing  
The country sound  
When I got home I sat in my kitchen  
And turned the television on (turned the TV on)  
The news wasn't good so I didn't listen  
I started clicking around  
Thinking of the town and the country  
I was thinking of the town and the country  
Thinking of the town and the country  
In the morning everything will be the same  
Open up your world (watch the children play)  
In the sun or rain  
Thinking of the town and the country  
A thinking of the town and the country  
I was thinking of the town and the country (fade)  


Well, she said all along, I'm her one  
A little fingernail polish, chewin' gum  
Her round the world heart made of platinum, that's right  
She looks like a China doll baby, especially in white  
A tropicana flower in the candlelight  
She turned into a pumpkin pie, sweet kiss at midnight  
She moves, oh so fine  
She's like a perfect valentine  
She's not one to fall in love  
She's too high on the stars above at night  
She wants to be your red-hot mama, all alone  
She dances with the boys on the telephone  
She makes a lotta noise in the quiet zone at night  
Yeah, you talk about a party at the beach, ain't that grand  
She just took a raincheck with another man  
Who lay on the deck of his catamaran some night  
She moves, oh so fine  
She's like a perfect valentine  
She's not one to fall in love  
She's too high on the stars above at night  
Well, I can't tell you much, but what I know (what I know)  
You can't take her with you when it's time to go  
'Cause she knows where it's at with a Romeo, you'll see  
She moves, oh so fine  
She's like a perfect valentine  
She's not one to fall in love  
She's too high on the stars above at night  
She moves  
Just like a perfect valentine  
She's not one to fall in love  
She's too high on the stars above at night  


Twinkling lights  
A chill is in the air  
And carols everywhere  
Close your eyes, it's almost here  
Candles and cards  
And favorite movie scenes  
The smell of evergreen  
As special as it's always been  
And I have a dream or two  
Maybe they will come true  
  
[Chorus:]  
Setting our hopes on a big snow tonight  
We'll wake up to a world of white  
It's gonna be a christmas to remember  
Light up the fire, play some Nat King Cole  
Always sentimental and don't you know that  
It's gonna be a Christmas to remember  
  
I know it's true  
Time doesn't stand still  
Many things can change  
But we know some things never will  
The memories we share  
The songs we always sing  
The mystery of life  
The hopefulness this season brings  
And I have a dream or two  
Maybe they will come true  
  
[Chorus:]


Abide with me, fast falls the eventide  
The darkenss deepens, Lord, with me abide  
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee  
Help of the helpless, O abide with me  
  
I need Thy presence every passing hour  
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?  
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?  
Through cloud and sunshine, o abide with me  
  
Abide, with me  
Abide, abide with me  
  
I fear no foe with Thee at hand to bless  
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness  
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, Thy victory?  
I triumph still if Thou abide with me  
  
Abide , with me  
Abide, abide with me  
Abide, with me  
Abide, abide with me


After the fire is over  
After the ashes cool  
After the smoke is blown away  
I will be is for you  
After the stillness finds you  
After the winds of change  
All that is good and true between us  
This will remain the same  
Slowly, slowly  
We turn the pages of life  
Growing, knowing  
It comes at quite a price  
After the fire is over  
After the ashes cool  
After the smoke is blown away  
I will be here for you  
After your time of wondering  
Along this lonely road  
There will be many voices calling  
Mine will say welcome home  
Slowly, slowly  
We turn the pages of life  
Growing, knowing  
It comes at quite a price  
After the fire is over  
After the ash is cool  
After the smoke is blown away  
I will be here for you  
I will be here for you  
  


Are you living in an old man's rubble?  
Listening to the father of lies?  
If you are then you're headed for trouble.  
Listen too long, you'll eventually die.  
  
Too late for walking in the middle,  
Too late to try.  
And it's too late for sitting in the balance,  
No more middle line.  
  
Are you puzzled by the way that you're behaving?  
You wonder why you do the things you do?  
Are you troubled by your lack of resistance?  
It feels like something's got a hold on you.  
  
Are you living in an old man's rubble?  
Listening to the father of lies?  
If you are then you're headed for trouble.  
If you listen too long, you'll eventually die.  
  
When I'm losing my sense of direction,  
And I'm needing some strength and protection,  
Walking away with You.  
I go walking away with You, and when I,  
When I think I can't stand any longer,  
And I'm crying for someone that's stronger,  
Walking away with You.  
I go walking away with You.  
  
El Shaddai, El Shaddai,  
El-Elyon na Adonai,  
Age to age, You're still the same,  
By the power of the name.  
  
El Shaddai, El Shaddai,  
Erkamka na Adonai,  
I will praise and lift You high,  
El Shaddai.  
  
I'm gonna fly.  
No one knows where,  
But I'm gonna fly.  
I'm lighter than air.  
  
And I'm gonna fly.  
No one knows where,  
But I'm gonna fly,  
And soar through the air.  
  
'Cause I have felt for the first time,  
I can be myself,  
No more faces to hide behind,  
Just a smile,  
And a dream that's mine.  
Even if I am  
The only one,  
Who wants to fly....  
  
I may not be every mother's dream for her little girl,  
And my face may not grace the mind of everyone in the world.  
But that's all right, as long as I can have one wish I pray:  
When people look inside my life, I want to hear them say,  
  
She's got her father's eyes.  
Her father's eyes.  
Her father's eyes, ya know.  
Just like my father's eyes.... (Sing, sing, sing!)  
  
(Sing, sing, sing!)  
(Sing, sing, sing!)  
  
Sing your praise to the Lord,  
Come on everybody,  
Stand up and sing... One more  
Hallelujah,  
Give your praise to the Lord,  
I can never tell you,  
Just how much good... That it's  
Gonna do ya,  
Just to sing, sing, sing....  
  
Come on, sii-hii-yiing!  
You know you really gotta sii-hii-yiing!  
Come on, sii-hii-yiing! (Sing, sing, sing!)  
  
I have decided,  
I'm gonna live like I believer,  
Turn my back on the deceiver.  
I'm gonna live what I believe.  
I have decided,  
Being good is just a fable,  
I just can't 'cause I'm not able.  
I'm gonna leave it to the Lord.  
  
Sing your praise to the Lord,  
Come on everybody,  
Stand up and sing... One more  
Hallelujah,  
Give your praise to the Lord,  
I can never tell you,  
Just how much good... That it's  
Gonna do ya,  
Just to sing, sing, sing.  
  
Come on, sii-hii-yiing,  
We've all gotta sii-hii-yiiiiiing!  
Come on, sing, sing, sing!


When the weight of all my dreams  
Is resting heavy on my head  
And the thoughtful words of help and hope  
Have all been nicely said  
But I'm still hurting, wondering if I'll ever be the one  
I think I am--I think I am.  
Then you gently re-remind me  
That You've made me from the first  
And the more I try to be the best  
The more I get the worst.  
And I realize the good in me is only there because of who  
You are, who You are.  
And all I ever have to be is what  
You've made me  
Any more or less would be a step out of Your plan  
As you daily recreate me help me always keep in mind  
That I only have to do what I can find  
And all I ever have to be  
All I have to be  
All I ever have to be is what You've made me  


Baby, baby  
I'm taken with the notion  
To love you with the sweetest of devotion  
  
Baby, baby  
My tender love will flow from  
The bluest sky to the deepest ocean  
  
Stop for a minute  
Baby, I'm so glad you're mine, yeah  
You're mine  
  
Baby, baby  
The stars are shining for you  
And just like me I'm sure that they adore you  
  
Baby, baby  
Go walking through the forest  
The birds above a' singing you a chorus  
  
Stop for a minute  
Baby, they're so glad you're mine, oh yeah  
And ever since the day you put my heart in motion  
Baby I realize that there's just no getting over you  
  
Baby, baby  
In any kind of weather  
I'm here for you always and forever  
  
Baby, baby  
No muscle man could sever  
My love for you is true and it will never  
  
Stop for a minute  
Baby, they're so glad you're mine  
And ever since the day you put my heart in motion  
Baby I realize that there's just no getting over you  
  
And ever since the day you put my heart in motion  
Baby I realize that there's just no getting over you  
Over you  
  
Baby, baby  
Always and forever  
Baby I'm so glad that  
Here for you baby  
So glad you're mine  
Baby I'm so glad that  
When I think about you it makes me smile  
Baby, baby be mine  
Baby I'm so glad that  
Don't stop giving love  
Don't stop, no  
Baby I'm so glad that you're mine  
Baby I'm so glad  
Baby I'm so glad that  
When I think about you it makes me smile


Once my life had no direction, I was lost as could be  
I was caught in a whirlpool, spinning around in misery  
I needed a friend, you took me in and you touched my heart  
With your song of love you gave me a brand new start  
Now there's beautiful music flowin' on through me just like you said  
Angels singin', joy bells ringing inside my head  
Since you came inside me, now I'm lost inside your love  
You gave me just enough to make me hunger for more of you  
Now I'm hooked on your lovin' and I don't want to break loose  
With my heart in my hand, I'm yours to command, do what you want me to  
Just never let me go, Lord, I'm so in love with you  
Now there's beautiful music flowin' on through me just like you said  
Angels singin', joy bells ringin' inside my head  
Since you came inside me, now I'm lost inside your love  
Beautiful music flowin' on through me just like you said  
Angels singin', joy bells ringin' inside my head  
Beautiful music flowin' on through me just like you said  
Angels singin', joy bells ringin' inside my head  


Little bits of heaven  
Floating gently by the window  
Soon this dirty city will be  
Covered with a new snow  
  
Let's put on our winter boots  
Go outside and play  
Christmas can't be very far away  
  
Weather girl says "bundle up"  
It's gonna be a cold one  
I'll put on my wooly hat  
You'll wear your dad's old Stetson  
  
Pretty lights are everywhere  
Shining night and day  
Christams can't be very far away  
  
Let's take a walk downtown and  
Go dream shopping in the mall  
The kids can do the Santa thing  
Photographs and all  
  
We'll get the biggest tree this year  
And trim it to the top  
And spend a whole lot more  
Than what we've got  
But so what  
  
Come next spring  
I know we will be  
Ready for the sunshine  
Right now throwin' snowballs  
At each other's such a fun time  
  
Kids will think we're crazy  
For awhile and that's okay  
Christmas can't be very far away  
Christmas can't be very far away


Are you far away from home  
This dark and lonely night  
Tell me what best would help  
To ease your mind  
Someone to give  
Direction for this unfamiliar road  
Or one who says, "Follow me and I  
Will lead you home. "  
  
How beautiful  
How precious  
The Savior of all  
To love so  
Completely  
The loneliest soul  
How gently  
How tenderly  
He says to one and all,  
"Child you can follow Me an  
I will lead you home  
Trust Me and follow Me  
And I will lead you home. "  
  
Be near me, Lord Jesus  
I ask Thee to stay  
Close by me forever  
And love me I pray  
Bless all the dear children  
In Thy tender care  
And take us to Heaven  
To live with Thee there  
Take us to Heaven  
To live with Thee there


Do you remember the time your heart was moved to tears?  
Can you look back on the moment after all these years?  
On the moment love broke through and heaven seemed so near  
Do you remember the time your heart was moved to tears?  
  
Do you remember the day you first let Jesus in?  
How he gently and tenderely washed away your sin  
Don't you know that He still cares the way He did back then?  
Do you remember the day you first let Jesus in?  
  
Keep holdin' on  
Never letting go  
We're not far  
from the end of the road  
  
Keep holdin' on  
Never letting go  
We're not far  
from the end of the road  
  
In a moment love broke through heaven and heaven seemed so near  
Do you remember the moment your heart was moved to tears?  
Do you remember the time your heart was moved to tears?

Let me give this testimony  
Reaffirm that you will find

Father, blessed Father it's morning again  
I give You Father, myself Father continue Your plan  
I know together we can climb mountains in the sky

Morning, morning, morning, morning  
Morning, morning, morning, morning  
Morning, morning, morning, morning  
Morning, morning, morning, morning, morning  


But there are so many  
Who don't know the reason  
Their lives are wasting away  
Just souls without purpose  
They wonder in darkness  
Without a thought for the day  
Well, I'm no Savior  
I'm just a window  
Through which Your sweet love light can shine  
So clean out the corners of my darkened pane  
And fill me with Your love again  
  
Fill me with Your love again  
Fill me with Your love again  
I open my heart and soul for you to enter me  
And fill me with Your love again  
  
Fill me with Your love again  
Fill me with Your love again  
I open my heart and soul for you to enter me  
And fill me with Your love again  
I open my heart and soul for you to enter me  
And fill me with Your love again


I will be walking one day  
Down a street far away  
And see a face in the crowd and smile  
Knowing how you made me laugh  
Hearing sweet echoes of you from the past  
I will remember you.  
  
Look in my eyes while you're near  
Tell me what's happening here  
See that I don't want to say good-bye  
Our love is frozen in time  
I'll be your champion and you will be mine  
I will remember  
I will remember you.  
  
Later on  
When this fire is an ember  
Later on  
When the night's not so tender  
Given time  
Though it's hard to remember darlin'  
I will be holding  
I'll still be holding to you  
So many years come and gone  
And yet the memory is strong  
One word we never could learn  
Good-bye  
True love is frozen in time  
I'll be your champion and you'll be mine  
I will remember you  
So please remember  
I will remember you  
I will remember you  
I will remember you  
I will remember you.


When I was a younger  
I used to dream a lot  
Staring into my coffee  
About how you'd love me  
And write me poetry  
And want to be with me, yeah  
Well, momma done told me  
You might wander far, yeah  
But nobody warned me  
The road would own your heart  
  
And so I'm saying  
If you have to go away  
I will be waiting by the phone  
And if you have to go away  
I'll put your records on  
Pretend you're still at home  
  
Now that I'm older  
I sit at home a lot  
With the kid we've got, yeah  
The radio's playing  
He really loves his wife  
I hear the D.J. saying  
Well momma done told me  
You might wander far, oh  
As long as you hold me  
More than you hold that guitar  
  
I'll keep on saying  
If you have to go away  
I'll leave your shoes beside the bed  
And if you have to go away  
I'll want to be with you  
I'll be with me instead  
If you have to go away  
I won't be sleeping very well  
But if you have to go away  
I'll be loving you  
Till it's cold in hell  
  
Maybe you'll write me this time  
Maybe you'll call on a static line  
Saying don't you ever worry your pretty mind  
Cause you and me are gonna be fine  
  
And so I'm saying  
If you have to go away  
I will be waiting by the phone  
And if you have to go away  
I'll put your records on  
Pretend you're still at home  
  
If you have to go away  
I'll leave your shoes beside the bed  
And if you have to go away  
I'll want to be with you  
I'll be with me instead  
If you have to go away  
I won't be sleeping very well  
But if you have to go away  
I'll be loving you  
I'll be loving you  
If you have to go away


Day turns to night, and I turn into bed.  
Can't get to sleep, something's in my head.  
Pacing the floor, I try to force a rhyme.  
Why do I fear this time?  
  
[Chorus]  
It's not a song till it touches your heart.  
It's not a song till it tears you apart.  
After what's left of what's right and what's wrong,  
Till it gets through to you,  
It's not a song.  
  
Now close your eyes, look into your hand.  
What do you see?  
Life is our song, to give and learn to take.  
Time will not wait.  
  
Oh, won't you please come dance,  
While the song's still playing,  
Won't be long till the silence falls.  
  
[Chorus: x4]


Consider the lilies of the field  
Solomon dressed in royal robes, has not the worth of them  
Consider the lilies of the field  
He takes after each and every need, leave all your cares behind  
Seek him and you will find Your Father loves you so  
Consider the creatures of the air  
For all of the diamonds in all the earth have not the wealth of them  
Consider the creatures of the air  
Jehovah loves them with tender hand, He knows your every care  
His touch is always there to see you through the night  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All You've done for me to set me free  
I'll never let You go  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All You've done for me to set me free  
I'll never let You go  
Consider the lilies of the field  
For how much more does He love His own? If Yaweh cares for them  
Consider the creatures of the air  
He takes after each and every need  
If we ask Him for bread, will He give us a stone?  
Jehovah loves His own  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All You've done for me to set me free  
I'll never let You go  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All You've done for me to set me free  
I'll never let You go  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All You've done for me to set me free  
I'll never let You go  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All You've done for me to set me free  
I'll never let You go  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All You've done for me to set me free  
I'll never let You go  
And Jehovah I love You so  
And Jesus I want You to know  
All You've done for me to set me free  
I'll never let you go  
And Jehovah I love you so  
And Jesus I want you to know  
All you've done for me to set me free  
I'll never let you go  
Never let you go  
Never go  


Just like tarzan,swinging on a vine.I move hard left then come back right.My
life is like a bommerang flow.It's far away then it's right back home.The
giant pendulum is swinging to and fro.This road were riding on where does it
go?And maybe soon is gone end than you never know.  
  
Chorus  
Hard as I try to get all arranged.Life's gonna change,uhh!Just when i'm used
to the pouring rain.That's when the sun starts shinin again.Life's Gonna
Change!  
  
Why not smile,while you got your smile.The tears might come.Might last a
while.Might as well live,while you got your life ,cause it's a little too late
when it's time to die.The giant pendulum is ticking off the days.I only blink
and may have passed away.And that's why anytime i turn around it's been
amazed.  
  
Repeat Chorus  
Just When I'm Used To The Pouring Rain.That's when the sun starts shinin
again!Life's Gonna Change!  
  
Instrumental  
Sun is gonna shine on me!

Just when i'm used to the pourin rain.That's when the sun starts shinin

I love to sing and I love to pray  
Worship the Lord most every day  
I go to the temple and I just want to stay  
To hide from the hustle of the world and its ways  
And I'd love to live on a mountain top  
Fellowshipping with the Lord  
I'd love to stand on a mountain top  
'Cause I love to feel my spirit soar  
But I've got to come down from that mountain top  
To the people in the valley below  
Or they'll never know that they can go  
To the mountain of the Lord  
Now praising the Father is a good thing to do  
To worship the trinity in spirit and truth  
But if we worshiped all of the time  
There would be no one to lead the blind  
But I'd love to live on a mountain top  
Fellowshipping with the Lord  
I'd love to stand on a mountain top  
'Cause I love to feel my spirit soar  
But I've got to come down from that mountain top  
To the people in the valley below  
Or they'll never know that they can go  
To the mountain of the Lord  
Now I am not saying that worship is wrong  
But worship is more than just singin' a song  
It's all that you say and everything that you do  
It's letting his spirit live through you  
Still I'd love to live on a mountain top  
Fellowshipping with the Lord  
I'd love to stand on a mountain top  
'Cause I love to feel my spirit soar  
But I've got to come down from that mountain top  
To the people in the valley below  
Or they'll never know that they can go  
To the mountain of the Lord  


Main street U.S.A boarded up and dry  
Knowin' what once was here just makes me want to cry  
Used to be the favorite place  
Now what remains are memories even time cannot erase  
Old man Johnson's store, where we grew up too fast  
All that remains today are echoes from the past  
Used to be a boomin' town  
All that's left is either broken up or broken down  
Singing, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah, oh  
Where we used to belong  
There ain't nobody home  
Said, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah, oh  
You can knock all you want  
But, ain't nobody home  
Packed up, moved away, runnin' from the past  
Leaving behind the dusty dreams and broken glass  
Used to be a busy town  
Now, everybody passes through, but they don't stick around  
  
(Chorus)  
Was a newsstand on the corner  
Right next to the barber shop  
And down the street there  
That's where all the kids would stop  
And they would tease the neighbor's bulldog  
Laugh and run away  
Now, there's no one left who knows the truth in what you say  
  
(Chorus)  
  
(Final Chorus)


If you think you're gonna fail  
Well, you're probably gonna fail  
So tell me, what was all the dreaming for?  
And if you think you're gonna lose  
Well, you're probably gonna lose  
So what's the point in trying anymore?  
  
What you're looking for, you'll find  
It happens every time  
  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
You can say you've had enough  
But I won't stop calling,  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
Not giving up on you  
  
When your fragile heart is breaking  
And your confidence is shaken  
I can tell you that we've all been there before  
The first step is hard to take  
But it's a choice you gotta make  
When life is waiting through that open door  
  
I wish that you could see  
The way you look to me  
  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
You can say you've had enough  
But I won't stop calling,  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
Not giving up on you  
  
Oh, not so long ago,  
You pulled me through  
  
So I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
Even if the rain comes down  
And your sky is falling  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
You can say you've had enough  
But I won't stop calling,  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
You know we can work this out  
If we just keep talking  
I'm not giving up,  
Not giving up on you  
Not giving up on you  
  
'Cause is you think you have a chance  
Then you really have a chance  
I hope you know that I believe in you


Where could I go, where could I run  
Even if I found the strength to fly  
And if I rose on the wings of the dawn  
And crashed through the corner of the sky  
If I sailed past the edge of the sea  
Even if I made my bed in Hell  
Still there You would find me  
'Cause nothing is beyond You  
You stand beyond the reach  
Of our vain imaginations  
Our misguided piety  
The heavens stretch to hold You  
And deep cries out to deep  
Singing that nothing is beyond You  
Nothing is beyond You  
Time cannot contain You  
You fill eternity  
Sin can never stain You  
Death has lost its sting  
And I cannot explain the way You came to love me  
Except to say that nothing is beyond You  
Nothing is beyond You  
If I should shrink back from the light  
So I can sink into the dark  
If I take cover and I close my eyes  
Even then You would see my heart  
And You'd cut through all my pain and rage  
The darkness is not dark to You  
And night's as bright as day  
Nothing is beyond You  
You stand beyond the reach  
Of our vain imaginations  
Our misguided piety  
The heavens stretch to hold You  
And deep cries out to deep  
Singing that nothing is beyond You  
Nothing is beyond You  
And time cannot contain You  
You fill eternity  
Sin can never stain You  
And death has lost its sting  
And I cannot explain the way You came to love me  
Except to say that nothing is beyond You  
Nothing is beyond You  
Nothing is beyond You  


O little town of Bethlehem  
How still we see thee lie  
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep  
The silent stars go by  
Yet in thy dark streets shineth  
The everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all the years  
Are met in thee tonight  
  
How silently, how silently  
The wondrous gift is given  
So God imparts to human hearts  
The blessings of His heaven  
We hear the Christmas angels  
The great glad tidings tell  
O come to us, abide with us  
Our Lord Emmanuel  
  
No ear may hear his coming  
But in this world of sin  
Where meek souls will receive Him  
Still the dear Christ enters in.


O love that will not let me go  
I rest my weary soul in thee  
I give thee back the life I owe  
That in thine ocean depths its flow  
My richer, fuller be  
  
O light that followest all my way  
I yield my flickering torch to thee  
My heart restores its borrowed ray  
That in thy sunshines glow its day  
May brighter, fairer be  
  
O joy you seek me through the pain  
I cannot close my heart to thee  
I trace the rainbow through the rain  
And feel the promise is not vain  
Then morn shall tearless be


O Master, let me walk with Thee  
In lowly paths of service free  
Tell me Thy secret, help me hear  
The strain of toil, the fret of care  
  
Teach me Thy patience, still with Thee  
In closer, dearer company  
In work that keeps faith sweet and strong  
In truth that triumphs over wrong  
  
O Master let me walk with Thee  
In closer, dearer company  
O Master let me walk with Thee  
Let me walk with Thee  
  
In hope that sends a shining ray  
Far down the future's broadening way  
In peace that only Thou canst give  
With Thee, O Master, let me live


O sacred head now wounded  
With grief and shame way down,  
Now scornfully surrounded  
With thorns thine only crown,  
  
How art thou pale with anguish,  
With sore abuse and scorn.  
How does that visage languish,  
Which once was bright as morn.  
  
What language shall i borrow  
To thank thee dearest man?  
For this, thy dying sorrow,  
Thy pity without end.  
  
O make me thine forever,  
And should i fainting be,  
Lord, let me never, ever  
Outlive my love to thee.


Are you living in an old man's rubble  
Are you listenin' to the father of lies  
Are you walking' with unnecessary burdens

And are you troubled by your lack of resistance  
Do you fell that something's got a hold on you

There's a voice of the darkness and the voice of the light  
And just by listening you've made a decision

They were the sweetest words I'd ever heard  
My heart could barely take it in  
Like water offered to the lips  
Of a tired and thirsty man  
  
'cause it's a tangled web of woven  
I don't know all the reasons  
But it amazes me to wake up  
To your mercy every morning  
  
So I'm standing here spinning around  
In the fields of freedom  
And I'm still alive and reaching out  
And I can feel the healing  
  
'cause you say  
Come on out come on out  
Come on out come on out  
Out in the open  
Come on out come on out  
Come on out come onout  
Into the light  
There is no jury  
There is no judge  
Ready and waiting  
Are the steady arms of love 124  
  
For the sake of never making waves I  
Kept my secrets to myself  
And no one ever really knew the  
Darker shadows of my heart  
  
But I will be a witness  
That there's nothing in me dark enough  
The power of forgiveness  
Cannot resuce from the deep  
  
So I'm standing here spinning around  
In the fields of freedom  
And I'm still alive and reaching out  
And I can feel the healing  
  
And you say  
Come on out come out  
Come on out come out  
Out in the open

We've got our little fingers workin' hard  
On the trains and dolls and cars  
Hurryin' 'cause Santa's a-waitin'  
Soldiers marchin' out the door  
Carryin' the toys galore  
For Santa's reindeer ride  
This is more than just another reindeer ride  
Not a practice run in July  
We've got to load up all the festive gear  
Peace, and hope, and yuletide cheer  
For Santa's reindeer ride  
Polish the runners, shine Rudolph's nose  
Tighten the harness, brush off the snow  
We'd love to sing our little working songs,  
Wish that we could tag along  
Just to see the children's faces  
Tonight the world is filled with joy,  
Deeper than the games and toys  
It's time to load up the sleigh.  
Tonight the world is filled with joy,  
Deeper than the games and toys  
It's time to load up the sleigh. (It's time to load up the sleigh).  
For Santa's reindeer ride.

I had laid some mighty plans  
Thought I held them in my hands  
Then my world began to crumble all away I tried to build it back again  
I couldn't bear to see it end  
How I hurt to know You wanted it that way.  
(Chorus)  
And I'm so glad, glad to find the reason  
That I'm happy-sad that  
You've torn it all away  
And I'm so glad, though it hurts to know I'm leaving Everything I ever thought
that I would be  
Once I held it in my hand  
It was a kingdom made of sand  
But now you've blown it all away  
I can't believe that I can say that I'm glad.  
Long before my plans were made I know a master plan was laid  
With a power that superceded my control  
And if that truth could pierce my heart I wouldn't wander from the start
Trying desperately to make it on my own.  
(Chorus)


My stubborn will at last hath yielded  
I would be Thine and Thine alone  
And this the prayer my lips are bringing  
Lord, let in me Thy will be done  
  
[Chorus]  
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer  
Til I am wholly lost in Thee  
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer  
Til I am wholly lost in Thee  
  
I'm tired of sin, footsore and weary  
The darksome path hath dreary grown  
But now a light has ris'n to cheer me  
I find in Thee my Star, my Sun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Thy precious will, O conqu'ring Savior  
Doth now embrace and compass me  
The storms have ceased, my peace a river  
My soul a prisoned bird set free  
  
[Chorus]


A king is crying from his throne  
He had a queen but now she's gone  
What is this magic that we seek  
The mighty strong turn mighty weak  
Every good girl hears it  
Every bad boy fears it  
No matter what i see  
I believe, i believe  
  
[Chorus:]  
The power touches me  
The power helps us see  
The power holds my hand  
The power drives me crazy  
  
A flower grows, an old man dies  
And through it all we still survive  
A poor man screams but no one hears  
Ain't nothing changed much through the years  
Every bad day needs it  
Every good day breeds it  
No matter how it feels  
When it's real you know it's real  
Stronger than any bomb that any man has ever made  
  
(repeat chorus)  
And it won't take long to understand  
Just how amazed i am  
  
Hey, hey  
Open up your eyes and see  
It won't take long to understand  
Just how amazed i am  
  
Every good day needs it  
Every bad day needs it  
No matter what i see  
I believe, i believe  
Stronger than any bomb any man has ever made  
  
(repeat chorus twice)  
The power drives me crazy  
If i believe and you believe  
And we believe everything is gonna be all right  
All right  
It just might  
  
(the power)  
(the power)  
(the power)  
(the power)


Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river  
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea  
You lay your bets and then you pay the price  
The things we do for love, the things we do for love.  
  
Communication is the problem to the answer  
You've got her number and your hand is on the phone  
The weather's turned and all the lines are down  
The things we do for love, the things we do for love.  
  
Like walking in the rain and the snow  
When there's nowhere to go  
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying  
And you're looking for the answer in his eyes.  
You think you're gonna break up  
Then he says he wants to make up.  
  
Ooh you made me love you  
Ooh you've got a way  
Ooh you had me crawling on the floor.  
  
Like walking in the rain and the snow  
When there's nowhere to go  
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying  
And you're looking for the answer in his eyes.  
You think you're gonna break up  
Then he says he wants to make up.  
  
Ooh you made me love you  
Ooh you've got a way  
Ooh you had me crawling on the floor.  
  
A compromise would surely help the situation  
Agree to disagree but disagree the part  
When after all it's just a compromise of  
The things we do for love, the things we do for love


The whispers in the morning of lovers sleeping tight  
Are rolling by like thunder now as I look in your eyes  
I hold on to your body and feel each move you make  
Your voice is warm and tender a love that I could not forsake  
'Cause you are my lady and I'm your man  
Whenever you reach for me I'll do all that I can  
Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms  
When the world outside's too much to take  
That all ends when I'm with you  
Even though there may be times it seems I'm far away  
But never wonder where I am cause I am always by your side  
'Cause you are my lady and I'm your man  
Whenever you reach for me I'll do all that I can  
We're heading for something somewhere I've never been  
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn  
'Bout the power of love  
The sound of your heart beating made it clear suddenly  
The feeling that I can't go on is light years away  
'Cause you are my lady and I'm your man  
Whenever you reach for me I'll do all that I can  
We're heading for something somewhere I've never been  
Sometimes I am frightened but I'm ready to learn  
'Bout the power of love


SOGNO  
  
Va ti aspettero'  
II fiore nel giardino segna il tempo  
Qui disegnero' il giomo poi del tuo ritorno  
Sei cosi sicura del mio amore  
Da portarlo via con te  
Chiuso nelle mani che ti porti al viso  
Ripensando ancora a me  
E se ti servira' lo mostri al mondo  
Che non sa che vita see'e'  
Nel cuore che distratto sembra assente  
Non sa che vita see'e'  
In quello che soltanto il cuore sente  
Non sa  
  
Qui ti aspettero'  
E rubero' i baci al tempo  
Tempo che non basta a cancellare  
Coi ricordi il desiderio che  
Resta chiuso nelle mani che ti porti al viso  
Ripensando a me  
E ti accompagnera' passando le citta' da me  
Da me che sono ancora qui  
E sogno cose che non so di te  
Dove sara' che strada fara' il tuo ritorno  
Sogno  
  
Qui ti aspettero'  
E rubero' i baci al tempo  
Sogno  
Un rumore il vento che mi sveglia  
E sei gia' qua


There's a wind that blows  
Its calling your name  
And its speaks to me again and again  
Telling me go to her  
Don't let her go  
Hold her close to you  
Then you will know  
The meaning of love  
Exactly what is all about  
The feeling that I get when I can't forget  
Everything that makes me want to  
That's how deep it goes  
All I really know is that I love you so  
  
And if its the only thing I ever do  
Then I know its true  
That I should love someone like you  
Someone who believes in me  
Makes my voice to sing with a heart so free  
As sure as I can be  
For me if one dream can come true  
Then I will love someone like you  
  
In your eyes I see  
A life that could mean so much more  
With you next to me  
And if time is cruel  
Well I won't try to hide  
I could walk through fire  
With you by my side  
Cause after all if we want forever  
There's a hand to hold through the sad and cold  
When nobody wants to know you  
So never let it go  
And you'll never be alone  
Knowing that I love you so  
  
And if its the only thing I ever do  
Then I know its true  
That I should love someone like you  
Someone who believes in me  
Makes my voice to sing with a heart so free  
As sure as I can be  
For me if one dream can come true  
Then I will love someone like you  
  
So never let it go  
And you'll never be alone  
Knowing that I love you so  
  
And if its the only thing, the only thing I ever do  
Then I know its true  
That I should love someone like you  
Someone who believes in me  
Makes my voice to sing with a heart so free  
As sure as I can be  
For me if one dream can come true  
Then I will love someone like you  
  
Then I should love someone like you


Voglio restare cosi,  
Magari fino in fondo,  
Il mondo attorno ormai  
Non mi interessa piu.  
Mi basta averti qui  
E stringerti cosi.  
  
Mi basta un gesto tuo  
Un sorriso,  
Una parola,  
E un attimo cosi  
Vale un'eternita  
Accendi un fuoco e poi  
Restiamo soli!  
Noi.  
  
[English: "I Want To Stay Like This"]  
I want to stay like this  
If possible to the end  
By now the world around  
No longer interests me  
It is enough that you are here  
And I hold you like this  
  
A gesture from you is enough  
A smile,  
A word,  
And a moment like this  
Is worth an eternity.  
Light a fire and then  
Let's be alone!  
Us.


A ray of hope flickers in the sky  
A tiny star lights up way up high  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass, when a child is born  
  
A silent wish sails the seven seas  
The winds of change whisper in the trees  
And the walls of doubt tumble tossed and torn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
  
A rosy hue settles all around  
You start to feel you're on solid ground  
For a spell or two no one seems forlorn  
This comes to pass, when a child is born  
  
It's all a dream, an illusion now  
It must come true, sometime soon somehow  
All across the land, dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass, when a child is born  
  
A ray of hope flickers in the sky  
A tiny star lights up way up high  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass, when a child is born  
  
This comes to pass ...


A fool never learns  
To get away, just run away before his heart begins to break  
A fool never learns  
He'll wait around, just hang around to see how much his heart can take  
A fool never learns  
To some girls love is just a game  
And some girls treat all fool the same  
A fool never learns  
And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing  
  
I'm gonna stick by you  
I'm a gonna hang around, wait around  
Hope she'll love me again some day  
They say a broken heart don't mark the end of time  
That there are lotsa girls who'd love to be just mine  
But I don't believe that I could fall in love again  
Cause I just can't remove the pain  
A fool never learns  
And I'm gonna do a very foolish thing  
  
I'm gonna stick by you  
I'm a gonna hang around, wait around  
Hope she'll love me again some day

(That baby doll) Oooohh!!  
(Look out for her) Ba-a-a-aby doll  
(Especially) Hmmmmmm!!  
(The amateur)  
  
There's many a guy who'll sing you these blues  
His dream was a lie, his heart's in his shoes  
He wasn't so green, in ways he was smart  
Till she hit the scene and she took him apart  
He'll tell you as plain as day  
"Keep away from ba-a-a-a-a-a-aby doll"  
  
(That baby doll)  
(Look out for her)  
  
You'll see in her eyes the warning you should  
You oughta be ooh-eyed, she'll lose you but good  
As long as she's warm, the livin' is sweet  
Then she'll raise a storm, you're back on the street  
You might as well know, my friend, that's the end  
You're cooked, you're through  
(My friend, you're through)  
(You're cooked, you're through)  
  
She was my baby doll and she'll do the same to you  
  
(That baby doll)  
(Look out for her)


The Christmas tree is decorated, all the shopping's done  
Stockings line the fireplace one by one  
All the presents look so pretty, tied with brightly colored bows  
All these things help make this season still everybody knows  
Christmas needs love to be Christmas  
Christmas needs hearts for a joy  
Carolers singing, silver bells ringing and laughter for each girl and boy  
Christmas needs love to be Christmas  
It's all that we all need more of year in, year out, I'm left with no doubt  
The greatest of all gifts is love  
Christmas needs love to be Christmas  
Christmas needs hearts for a joy  
Carolers singing, silver bells ringing and laughter for each girl and boy  
Christmas needs love to be Christmas  
It's all that we all need more of year in, year out, I'm left with no doubt  
The greatest of all gifts is love  


The days of wine and roses laugh and run away like a child at play  
Through a meadow land toward a closing door  
A door marked "nevermore" that wasn't there before  
  
The lonely night discloses just a passing breeze filled with memories  
Of the golden smile that introduced me to  
The days of wine and roses and you  
  
(The lonely night discloses) Just a passing breeze filled with memories  
Of the golden smile that introduced me to  
The days of wine and roses and you-oo-oo.


Falling in love with love is falling for make believe  
Falling in love with love is playing the fool  
Caring too much is such a juvenile fancy  
Learning to trust is just for children in school  
  
I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full  
I was unwise with eyes unable to see  
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting  
But love fell out with me  
  
Oh, I fell in love with love one night when the moon was full  
I was unwise with eyes unable to see  
I fell in love with love, with love everlasting  
But love fell out with me


If it takes forever I will wait for you  
For a thousand summers I will wait for you  
Till you're back beside me, till I'm holding you  
Till I hear you sigh here in my arms  
  
Anywhere you wander, anywhere you go  
Every day remember how I love you so  
In your heart believe what in my heart I know  
That forevermore I'll wait for you  
  
The clock will tick away the hours one by one  
Then the time will come when all the waiting's done  
The time when you return and find me here and run  
Straight to my waiting arms  
  
If it takes forever I will wait for you  
For a thousand summers I will wait for you  
Till you're here beside me, till I'm touching you  
And forevermore sharing your love


If I could only go back again  
To the places where I have I have been  
Feeling love as we did then  
If I could only go back, if I could only go back  
  
Crystal waters of yesterday  
Golden rainbows you washed away  
Lonely clouds that can only say  
If I could only go back, if I could only go back  
  
To live in your arms again  
To love like we did then  
To run free as the wind forever  
  
Silver wings of eternity  
Take me back like the child to see  
Faces lost in the memories  
If I could only go back, if I could only go back  
  
To live in your arms again  
To love as we did then  
To run free as the wind forever, run


Hear the lonesome whippoorwill  
He sounds too blue to fly  
The midnight train is winding low  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
  
I've never seen a night so long  
Where time goes crawling by  
The moon just went behind a cloud  
To hide its face and cry  
  
The silence of a falling star  
Lights up a purple sky  
And as I wonder where you are  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
  
I'm so lonesome I could cry  
I'm so lonesome I could cry


It's a most unusual day  
Feel like throwing my worries away  
As an old native-born Californian would say  
It's a most unusual day  
There's a most unusual sky  
Not a sign of a cloud passing by  
And if I want to sing, throw my heart in the ring  
It's a most unusual day  
There are people meeting people  
There is sunshine everywhere  
There are people greeting people  
And a feeling of Spring in the air  
It's a most unusual time  
I keep feeling my temperature climb  
If my heart won't behave in the usual way  
Well, there's only one thing to say  
It's a most unusual day  
There are people meeting people  
There is sunshine everywhere  
There are people greeting people  
And a feeling of Spring in the air  
I keep feeling my temperature climb, climb, climb, climb, climb, climb, climb  
Till there is only one thing to say  
It's a most, most, most, most, most unusual, most unusual  
Most unusual da-ay-ay  
Most unusual da-ay


This is the night of love  
The shining hour of Kalua  
Her song is in the air  
Her lips are waiting there  
Who will be Kalua's only love?  
  
Who will her lover be?  
Who will her lover be?  
  
Before the night is old  
My arms will hold Kalua  
And where the trandewinds blow  
Soft and low  
  
Our love will blossom bright  
In the night  
And stars will sing above  
The love song of Kalua


Where do I begin  
To tell the story  
Of how great a love can be  
The sweet love story  
That is older than the sea  
The simple truth about the love she brings to me  
Where do I start  
  
With her first hello  
She gave new meaning  
To this empty world of mine  
There'll never be  
Another love, another time  
She came into my life  
And made the living fine  
She fills my heart  
  
She fills my heart  
With very special things  
With angel songs  
With wild imaginings  
She fills my soul  
With so much love  
That anywhere I go  
I'm never lonely  
With her along who could be lonely  
I reach for her hand  
It's always there  
  
How long does it last  
Can love be measured by the hours in a day  
I have no answers now  
But this much I can say  
I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away  
And she'll be there  
How long does it last  
Can love be measured by the hours in a day  
I have no answers now  
But this much I can say  
I know I'll need her 'till the stars all burn away  
And she'll be there


May each day in the week be a good day  
May the Lord always watch over you  
And may all of your hopes turn to wishes  
And may all of your wishes come true  
  
May each day in the month be a good day  
May you make friends with each one you meet  
And may all of your daydreams be mem'ries  
And may all of your mem'ries be sweet  
  
The weeks turn to months and the months into years  
There'll be sadness and joy, there'll be laughter and tears  
But one thing I pray to heaven above  
May each of your days be a day full of love  
  
May each day in the year be a good day  
May each dawn find you happy and gay  
And may all of your days be as lovely  
As the one you shared with me today  
  
May each day of your life be a good day  
And good night.  
  


I don't remember what day it was  
I didn't notice what time it wa-as  
All I know is that I fell in love with you  
And if all my dreams come true  
I'll be spending time with you...  
  
Every day's a new day in love with you  
With each day comes a new way of loving you  
Every time I kiss your lips my mind starts to wander  
And if all my dreams come true  
I'll be spending time with you  
  
Oh, I love you more today than yesterday  
But not as much as tomorrow (yesterday)  
I love you more today than yesterday  
But, darling, not as much as tomor-orrow-ow  
  
Tomorrow's date means springtime's just a day away  
Cupid, we don't need you now, be on your way  
I thank the Lord for love like ours that grows ever stronger  
And I always will be true  
I know you feel the same way too  
  
Oh, I love you more today than yesterday  
But not as much as tomorrow (yesterday)  
I love you more today than yesterday  
But, darling, not as much as tomor-orrow-ow  
  
Every day's a new day, every time I love you  
Every way's a new way, every time I love you  
Every day's a new day, every time I love you  
Every day's a new day [fade]

One day of your life is all I'm askin' girl,  
Just give me one day of your life and let me share your world.  
If you give me one little moment I will make this moment last,  
I'll live the future with the past.  
  
One day of your life can't mean that much to you,  
It's only one day of your life, but it will see me through.  
If I can't have you for ever, if I can't have things my way  
I'll be content with just one day.  
  
If I must build a world of fantasy,  
Please with a memory.  
  
One day of your life is all I'm asking girl,  
Just give me one day of your life and let me share your world.  
If I can't have you for ever, if I can't have things my way  
I'll be content with just one day.  
  
One day of your life,  
Ooooh one day of your life,  
It's only one day of your life,  
Just give me only one day of your life  


Quiet nights and quiet stars  
Quiet chords from my guitar  
Floating on the silence that surrounds us  
  
Quiet nights and quiet dreams  
Quiet walks by quiet streams  
And the window lookin' on the mountains and the sea how lovely  
  
This is where to be  
Here with you so close to me  
Till the final flicker of life's ember  
  
I who was lost and lonely  
Believing life was a only a bitter tragic joke  
Have found with you the meaning of existence oh, my love  
  
(instrumental interlude)  
  
This is where to be  
Here with you so close to me  
Till the final flicker of life's ember  
  
I who was lost and lonely  
Believing life was a only a tragic joke  
Have found with you the meaning of existence oh, my love


Say it isn't so  
Say it isn't so.  
Everyone is saying you don't love me,  
Say it isn't so.  
  
Everywhere I go,  
Everyone I know  
Whispers that you're growing tired of me,  
Say it isn't so.  
  
People say that you  
Found somebody new,  
And it won't be long before you leave me,  
Say it isn't true.  
  
Say that everything is still okay,  
That's all I want to know.  
And what they're saying,  
Say it isn't so.  
  
People say passing by  
Say he's younger than I  
And it won't be long before you leave me,  
Tell me it's a lie.  
  
Say that everything is still okay,  
That's all I want to know.  
And what they're saying,  
Say it isn't so.


Don't talk of stars burning above  
If you're in love show me  
Tell me no dreams filled with desire  
If you're on fire show me  
Here we are together in the middle of the night  
Don't talk of spring, just hold me tight  
Anyone whose ever been in love will tell you that  
This is no time for a chat  
  
Haven't your lips longed for my touch  
  
Don't say how much, show me, show me  
Don't talk of love lasting through time  
Make me no undying vow  
Show me show me  
  
Haven't your lips longed for my touch  
Don't say how much, show me, show me  
Don't talk of love lasting through time  
Make me no undying vow  
Show me show me now


What is so rare as a day in June?  
'Till now we have never been told  
The old question's answered by one that is new  
What is so rare, dear, as you?  
  
So rare, you're like the fragrance of blossoms fair  
Sweet as a breath of air  
Fresh with the morning dew  
So rare You're like the sparkle of old champagne  
Orchids in cellophane  
Couldn't compare to you  
You are perfection you're my idea  
Of angels singing the Ave Maria  
For you're an angel, I breathe and live you  
With every beat of the heart that I give you  
So rare, This is a heaven on earth we share  
Caring the way we care  
Ours is a love so rare  
  
So rare, You have the warmth of a Schubert air  
Charming and debonaire  
Those are the words for you  
So rare You have a way that's beyond compare  
That "one in a million" air  
In everything you do  
You have that something, that certain manner  
You thrill me more than the "Star Spangled Banner"  
You stage a love scene, so sweetly tender  
And in that love scene I gladly surrender  
So rare, to have a future like yours to share  
Sweetheart the way we care  


My first lesson  
In losin' love was you  
Learnin' to live with your memory  
Was lesson number two  
And I can't lie  
Baby I still cry sometimes  
But I've come a long way  
Towards gettin' you out of my mind  
I'm still under the weather  
But I'm over the storm  
I still miss the shelter  
Of your lovin' arms  
But what I thought would kill me  
Has just made me strong  
I'm still under the weather  
But I'm over the storm  
Sometimes your memory  
Still gets the best of me  
But that lonely ache in my heart  
Ain't as bad as it used to be  
And sometimes the way that I'm feelin'  
Inside doesn't show  
But I know  
I'll get over you, I've just got a long way to go  
I'm still under the weather  
But I'm over the storm  
I still miss the shelter  
Of your lovin' arms  
But what I thought would kill me  
Has just made me strong  
I'm still under the weather  
But I'm over the storm  
I'm still under the weather  
But I'm over the storm  


That old Bilbao moon, I won't forget it soon  
That old Bilbao moon, just like a big balloon  
That old Bilbao moon would rise above the dune  
While Tony's Beach Saloon rocked with an old-time tune  
We'd sing a song the whole night long and I can still recall  
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)  
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)  
Those were the greatest nights of them all  
No paint was on the door (no paint was on the door)  
The grass grew through the floor (the grass grew through the floor)  
Of Tony's Two By Four (of Tony's Two By Four)  
On the Bilbao shore (on the Bilbao shore)  
But there were friends galore (howdy do, howdy do)  
And there was beer to pour (chug-a-lug, chug-a-lug)  
And moonlight on the shore (and the moon shines above)  
That old Bilbao shore (on the shore, not the floor)  
We'd sing all night with all our might and I can still recall  
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)  
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)  
Those were the greatest nights of them all  
That old Bilbao moon, I won't forget it soon  
That old Bilbao moon, just like a big balloon  
That old Bilbao moon would rise above the dune  
While Tony's Beach Saloon rocked with an old-time tune  
We'd sing all night with all our might and I can still recall  
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)  
Those were the greatest (those were the greatest)  
Those were the greatest nights of them all


Walk hand in hand with me through all eternity  
Have faith, believe in me, give me your hand  
Love is a symphony of perfect harmony  
When lovers such as we walk hand in hand  
Be not afraid, for I am with you all the while  
So lift your head up high and look toward the sky  
Walk hand in hand with me, this is our destiny  
No greater love could be, walk hand in hand  
Walk with me  
Be not afraid, for I am with you all the while  
So lift your head up high and look up to the sky  
Walk hand in hand with me, this is our destiny  
No greater love could be, walk hand in hand  
Walk with me  


It seems we stood and talked like this before  
We looked at each other in the same way then  
But I can't remember where or when  
The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore  
  
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then  
But I can't remember where or when  
Some things that happened for the first time  
Seem to be happening again  
  
And so it seems that we have met before  
And laughed before, and loved before  
But who knows where or when


Sleigh bells ring  
are you listening  
in the lane  
snow is glistening  
A beautiful sight  
we're happy tonight  
walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away is the bluebird  
here to stay is a new bird  
He sings a love song  
as we go along  
walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say: Are you married?  
we'll say: No man  
But you can do the job  
when you're in town  
  
Later on  
we'll conspire  
as we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid  
the plans that we've made  
walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
and pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman  
until the all the kids knock him down  
  
When it snows  
ain't it thrilling  
Though your nose gets a chilling  
We'll frolic and play  
the Eskimo way  
walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
walking in a winter wonderland


Words and Music by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe  
  
From the Broadway musical "My Fair Lady"  
  
  
I'm gettin' married in the morning  
Ding dong the bells are gonna chime  
Pull out the stopper, let's have a whopper  
But get me to the church on time  
  
I gotta be there in the morning  
Spruced up and looking in my prime  
Girls, come and kiss me, show how you'll miss me  
But get me to the church on time  
  
If I am dancing, roll up the floor  
If I am whistling, whisk me out the door, for  
  
I'm gettin' married in the morning  
Ding dong the bells are gonna chime  
Kick up a rumpus but don't lose your compass  
And get me to the church, get me to the church  
For Pete's sake, get me to the church on time


Words and Music by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe  
  
All I want is a room somewhere  
Far away from the cold night air  
With one enormous chair  
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?  
  
Lots of chocolate for me to eat  
Lots of coal makin' lots of 'eat  
Warm face, warm 'ands, warm feet  
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?  
  
Oh so loverly sittin' abso-bloomin'-lutely still  
I would never budge till Spring crept over mi window sill  
  
Someone's 'ead restin' on my knee  
Warm and tender as 'e can be  
Who takes good care of me  
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?  
  
Who takes good care of me  
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly? (loverly)  
Loverly (lovely)  
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?


You go on your way  
I'll go on mine  
Please don't you call me  
Or drop me a line  
  
I'll be better off now  
With somebody new  
And you should find someone  
More suited to you  
  
Cause we're wrong for each other  
Wrong for each other  
Let's fight another round  
  
I couldn't explain it  
I can't tell you why  
I've got such a talent  
For making you cry  
  
And one day you'll thank me  
For saying so long  
For making an end to  
A love that was wrong  
  
Cause we're wrong for each other  
Wrong for each other  
Let's fight another round  
  
Cause we're wrong for each other  
Wrong for each other  
Wrong for each other  
Wrong for each other...


In the summertime when all the trees and leaves are green  
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
"Some other time", that's whatcha say when I want you  
Then you laugh at me and make me cry  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
You don't seem to care a thing about me  
You'd rather live without me  
Than to have my arms around you  
When the nights are cold and you're so all alone (all alone)  
  
[Chorus]  
In the summertime when all the trees and leaves are green  
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
Once upon a time you used to smile and wave to me  
And walk with me but now you don't  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
Some other guy is takin' up all your time  
Now ya don't have any time for me  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
You don't seem to care a thing about me  
You'd rather live without me  
Than to have my arms around you  
When the nights are cold and you're so all alone (all alone)  
  
In the summertime when all the trees and leaves are green  
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
In the summertime when all the trees and leaves are green  
And the redbird sings, I'll be blue  
Cause you don't want my love  
  
(In summertime, in summertime when all the leaves are green)  
In the summertime, I'll be blue all the time  
Cause you don't want my love


Don't give up when you feel you are far away  
You can lose yourself in the sound like it's yesterday  
When the world won't stop and it gets too loud  
We can drown it on, we can turn it round  
When the music high we can sing alone,  
  
Bring us back in time, to what we love.  
Chorus:  
Uh uh uh uh uh uh  
Bring us back together, back together  
Uh uh uh uh uh uh  
Bring us back together, back together  
When we need it most, it will bring us close  
He's what we all belong  
When we need it most, it will bring us close  
He's what we all belong  
Don't give up, don't believe it could ever change  
You're not alone and everybody it feels the same  
When the world won't stop and it gets too loud  
We can drown it on, we can turn it round  
When the music high we can sing alone,  
Bring us back in time, to what we love.  
Chorus:  
Uh uh uh uh uh uh  
Bring us back together, back together  
Uh uh uh uh uh uh  
Bring us back together, back together  
When we need it most, it will bring us close  
He's what we all belong  
When we need it most, it will bring us close  
He's what we all belong  
Keeps us together and keep us strong  
When we're together music plays on and on.  
[Chorus:]  
When we ahh, when we ahh  
When we ahh, when we ahh  
When we need it most, it will bring us close  
And he's what we all belong


That's my cigar

Since when did you become me mada  
Ahh stop your ballin  
Hey who asked you?

Try central park its garenteed  
Try any banker, bum or barba

I smell money  
You smell foul  
Met this girl last night  
Hey move you elbow  
Pass the towel  
For a buck I might  
  
Chorus:  
And its a fine life carrying the banner through it all  
A mighty fine life carrying the banner tough and tall  
Every morning we goes where we wishes  
Wes as free as finshes  
Sure beets washin dishes  
What a fine life carrying the banner through it all  
  
Its takes a smile as sweet as butta  
The kind the ladies can't resist  
It takes an orphane with a studda  
Who aint afraid to use his fist  
  
Summa stinks and winters wating  
Welcome to new york  
Boy aint nature fasinating  
When yous gotta walk  
  
Chorus  
  
Aint it a fine life carrying th banner through it all!


There was a time  
Everybody was around and I was dancing with you  
We all went down to the party Friday night  
And had a drink there or two  
Oh what a heat  
I feel love and heart beat  
It's electricity  
Majestic sound, round and round and round, got you next to me  
  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a symphony  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a melody, come see  
  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a symphony  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a melody, come see  
  
Time after time everybody came around  
And I was dancing with you  
Don't know your name,  
Making me ashamed  
To feel the way that I do  
The lights went out  
Couldn't leave without you, this is the place to be  
I won't forget  
The greatest times I've had when I was dancing with you  
  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a woman in love  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a woman in love so high  
  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a symphony  
Feel my heartbeat drumming to the beat  
Like a melody, come see  
  
Feel my heartbeat  
Feel my heartbeat  
Feel my heartbeat  
  
There was a time when everybody was around and I was dancing with you  
Don't know your name,  
Making me ashamed  
To feel the way that I do  
The lights went out  
Couldn't leave without you, this is the place to be  
I won't forget  
The greatest times I've had when I was dancing with you


Grace: We got Annie.  
  
Gardener: We've got Annie?  
  
Grace: Yeah!  
She's like the shine on your shoes,  
or hearing a blues that's great.  
Makes you relax,  
like a big tax rebate!  
We got Annie!  
  
Servants: We got Annie! We got Annie? We got Annie!  
  
Mrs. Pugh: And Benny Goodman's got swing.  
Bing is a king, by far.  
Mutt has got Jeff,  
and Eleanor, F. D. Are.!

All  
  
Today we're living in a shanty  
Today we're scrounging for a meal  
  
Sophie  
  
Today I'm stealing coal for fires  
Who knew I could steal?  
  
Men  
  
I used to winter in the tropics  
  
Women  
  
I spent my summers at the shore  
  
Fred  
  
I used to throw away the paper  
  
All  
He don't anymore!  
We'd like to thank you: Herber Hoover  
For really showing us the way  
We'd like to thank you: Herbert Hoover  
You made us what we are today  
  
Prosperity was 'round the corner  
A cozy cottage built for two  
In this blue heaven  
That you  
Gave us  
Yes!  
  
We're turning blue!  
They offered us Al Smith and Hoover  
We paid attention and we chose  
Not only did we pay attention  
We paid through the nose.  
  
In ev'ry pot he said "a chicken"  
But Herbert Hoover he forgot  
Not only don't we have the chicken  
We ain't got the pot!  
Hey Herbie  
  
Women  
  
You left behind a greatful nation  
  
All  
  
So, Herb, our hats are off to you  
We're up to here with admiration  
  
Sophie  
  
Come down and have a little stew  
  
All  
  
Come down and share some Christmas dinner  
Be sure to bring the missus too  
We got no turkey for our stuffing  
So why don't we stuff you  
We'd like to thank you, Herbert Hoover  
For really showing us the way  
You dirty rat, you Bureaucrat, you  
Made us what we are today  
Come and get it, Herb!


Baby I got love for thee  
So deep inside of me I don't know where to start  
I love you more than anything  
But the words cant even touch what's in my heart  
  
When I try to explain it I be sounding insane  
The words don't ever come out right  
I get all tongue tied (and twisted)  
I can't explain what I'm feeling  
  
And I say baby, baby  
Baby (baby I)  
Oh baby, oh baby, my baby (Baby I)  
Oh baby, baby I (baby I)  
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby  
But every time I try to say it words they only complicate it  
  
Baby, baby (Ooh oh)  
  
Baby I'm so down for you  
No matter what you do (real talk) I'll be around  
Oh baby, see baby I been feelin' you  
Before I even knew what feelings were about  
Oh baby  
  
When I try to explain it I be sounding all crazy  
The words don't ever come out right  
I get all tongue tied (and twisted)  
I can't explain what I'm feeling  
  
And I say baby, baby  
Baby (baby I)  
Oh baby, oh baby, my baby (baby I)  
Oh baby, baby I (baby I)  
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby  
But every time I try to say it words they only complicate it  
  
Baby, baby  
Baby, baby  
  
Straight up, you got me  
All in, how could I not be  
I sure hope you know (I sure hope you know)  
If it's even possible, I love you more  
Than word love can say it  
It's better not explaining that's why I keep saying baby I  
  
Ooh baby, oh baby, my baby (Baby I)  
Oh baby, baby I (baby I)  
All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby  
But every time I try to say it words they only complicated  
  
Baby, baby (baby)  
Baby, baby (baby I)  
Ooh baby oh baby oh baby (Baby I)  
Oh baby  
(Baby I) All I'm tryna say is you're my everything baby  
But every time I try to say it words they only complicated  
Every time I try to say it words they only complicated  
Every time I try to say it words they only complicated  
  
Baby, baby  
Baby, baby


[Verse 1]  
If you want it, take it  
I should have said it before  
Tried to hide it, fake it  
I can't pretend anymore  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I only want to die alive  
Never by the hands of a broken heart  
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight  
Now that I've become who I really am  
  
[Chorus]  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
You were better, deeper  
I was under a spell  
Like a deadly fear I am, babe  
On the highway to hell  
  
I only want to die alive  
Never by the hands of a broken heart  
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight  
Now that I've become who I really am  
  
[Bridge]  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
[Chorus]  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
(Our love baby, oooh)  
The thought on your body  
I came alive  
It was lethal  
It was fatal  
In my dreams it felt so right  
But I woke up and pretend  
Oh baby  
  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more  
  
This is the part when I say I don't want it  
I'm stronger than I've been before  
This is the part when I break free  
Cause I can't resist it no more

In love with you and me and my girls don't know what-to-do oh oh oh

Like this before. Direct contact ah ah ah no more.

Tryin' to find the end (end)  
Bumped into this shy guy  
While chillin' with my friends (friends)  
  
He's eyein' me, his eyes on me  
Makes my body weak  
He's bringing out the freak in me  
It's only been a minute  
Since you came in, and changed my li-ife  
When I get around you, I feel this spark igni-ite  
  
I got that fire, you got me open  
You dig it deeper, we take it higher x2

I looked in my rear view mirror and  
It seemed to make a lot more sense  
Than what I see ahead of us,  
Ahead of us, yeah.  
Uh I'm ready to make that turn  
Before we both crash and burn  
'Cause that could be the death of us,  
The death of us,  
  
Baby you know how to drive in rain  
And You decided not to make a change  
Stuck in the same old lane  
Going the wrong way home  
  
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper  
Traffic, I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you  
The way that I want  
Let's just go back to the way it was  
  
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue  
Honeymoon Avenue  
Baby, coastin' like crazy

Guess they didn't count at that stop sign  
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light  
Hey, right when I think that we found it  
Well that's when we start turnin' around  
You're saying baby don't worry  
But we're still going the wrong way baby  
  
Baby you know how to drive in rain  
And you decided not to make a change  
Stuck in the same old lane  
Going the wrong way home

They say only fools fall in love  
Well they must've been talking about us  
And sometimes I feel like, I've been here before  
Ah

We gon' be lost if we continue to fight  
Honey I know  
Yeah, we can find our way home  
  
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper

[Verse 1]  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
I don't ever ask you where you've been  
And I don't feel the need to  
Know who you're with  
I can't even think straight but I can tell  
That you were just with her  
And I'll still be a fool  
I'm a fool for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want

Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
[Verse 2]  
I don't ever tell you how I really feel  
Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean  
And nothing's ever easy  
That's what they say  
I know I'm not your only  
But I'll still be a fool  
Cause I'm a fool for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want  
Just a little bit of your heart

Just a little bit is all I'm asking for  
Oh, oh, (Just a little bit) oh, oh (Hallelujah)

I hear a little love is better than none  
Oh babe

Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want

Just a little bit is all I'm asking for  
  
[Chorus]  
Just a little bit of your heart  
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit baby)  
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want (Is all I want)  
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit)  
Just a little bit of your heart (Just a little bit)  
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for

In black and white, no sleeping  
So tonight I'm gonna flip it  
Like in a New York minute  
We're gonna hail a cab  
And don't look back  
Once we get in it  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Lemme hear you say  
Ooooh  
Can't keep it bottled up.  
Lemme hear you say  
Ooooh  
Can't keep it bottled up  
  
[Chorus]  
Make it pop like pink champagne  
In the purple rain  
We gonna paint paint paint the city  
We're gonna show em how to  
Look all pretty, pretty in  
Pink champagne  
Let 'em know our names.  
Scream it so loud  
They'll hear us in la  
We're poppin' like pink champagne  
Poppin' like pink champagne  
Poppin' like pink champagne  
  
[Verse 2]  
Don't need no guest list  
Everybody's invited  
I said even if you can't get in  
We'll dance outside it  
We're gonna make this bubble  
Carbonate some trouble  
When the night gets black  
Gotta take it back to another level  
  
Lemme hear you say  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Ooooh  
Can't keep it bottled up.  
Lemme hear you say  
Ooooh  
Can't keep it bottled up.  
  
[Chorus]  
Make it pop like pink champagne  
In the purple rain  
We gonna paint paint paint the city  
We're gonna show em how to  
Look all pretty, pretty in  
Pink champagne  
Let 'em know our names.  
Scream it so loud  
They'll hear us in la  
We're poppin' like pink champagne  
Poppin' like pink champagne  
Poppin' like pink champagne  
  
[Bridge]  
Make it pop  
Oooohhh  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Lemme hear you say  
Ooooh  
Can't keep it bottled up  
Lemme hear you say  
Ooooh  
Can't keep it bottled up  
  
[Chorus]  
Make it pop like pink champagne  
In the purple rain  
We're gonna paint paint paint the city  
We're gonna show em how to  
Look all pretty, pretty in  
Pink champagne  
Let 'em know our names.  
Scream it so loud.  
They'll hear us in la  
We're poppin' like pink champagne  
Poppin' like pink champagne  
Poppin' like pink champagne

This for my number one girl who got the top spot title  
Spent a hour in the bathroom walked out looking like a model  
God! Doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo  
On the moon, Who needs genies in a bottle girl  
If they already got you  
  
Boy you make me feel so lucky  
Finally the stars align  
Never has it been so easy, to be in love  
And to give you this heart of mine  
You know what I need (Eh! )  
I know what you like (Eh! )  
Put it all together baby we could be alright (Hey)  
How could this be wrong  
When it feels so right  
Yeah, I really love you I really love you  
  
And I'll never let you go  
You should know

You got it, you got it babe (If you wanna party, if you, if you wanna party)  
  
And I get butterflies, just thinking  
About you boy, you're on my mind  
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming  
Lost in in your eyes and I lose all track of time  
You know what I need (Eh! )  
I know what you like (Eh! )  
Put it all together baby we could be alright (Hey)  
How could this be wrong

No one compares  
And if you never change  
I'm gonna stay right there (What, Okay, What)  
I'll always be right there  
  
Now if all fell through it  
Would you catch me before the pavement  
If my Benz turned back to Public Transportation  
Would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting  
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary  
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary  
My black book, and numbers thicker than the dictionary  
And bible I got to recycle  
I love and I like you  
Five course meals even though you don't mind a drive-thru  
That's why I got you  
  
And I'll never let you go (I got you)  
You should know  
I'm never gonna change  
I'm always gonna stay  
You call for me, I'm right there (right there)  
Right there  
Cause you listen  
And you care  
You're so different  
No one compares  
And if you never change  
I'm gonna stay right there  
I'll always be right there

You got it, I'll always be right there  
Always be right there, you got it, you got it babe

You may not show it  
I may not know it  
But it's real as it can be  
You need no season  
I need no reason  
When it's your heart singin'  
This was meant to be  
  
When you're both in love  
Both in love...  
Seein' eye to eye and feelin'  
Heart to heart  
Yes, we're both in love  
Both in love  
With each other from the start  
Ev'rythin's magic  
When we're together  
In this wonderland for two  
There's nothing like it  
Won't try to hide it  
Anyone can tell there's nothin' you can do  
  
There's no need to worry  
Which starts we're under  
We've got all we need to know  
We have the answer  
Forever after  
You're the one for me  
And I'm the one for you  
(Instrumental)


(Lea)  
I've been thinking  
It seems we're going nowhere  
You don't share my feelings  
It doesn't seem fair  
I guess there's nothing  
Much more I can do  
I know I've got to try  
And make it without you  
I don't love you anymore  
Can't you see, it's just no good  
I've gotta walk out that door  
There's nothing left to say  
I've gotta go my way  
Try and understand  
(Ariel)  
We've had bad times  
But that's no reason to go  
I can't live without you  
I need you, don't you know  
That I still love you  
Don't, don't do this to me  
You know I won't make it alone  
Can't you see  
(L) I don't love you anymore  
(A) Don't do this to me  
(L) Can't you see it's just no good  
I've gotta walk out that door

sana'y kaya kong gawin na malimutan ka  
sana'y maitago ko ang luha ng mga mata  
sana'y kayang tiisin na magmula ngayo'y di na magkita pa  
ngayong wala ka na  
  
ii stanza  
ang akala ko noon ay di kita mahal  
at ang pagtingin sayo'y isang laro lamang  
labis na sinaktan ka at sa ngayo'y nagpapaalam na...  
di mapigilan pa  
  
chorus:  
minamahal pala kita  
ngayon ko lamang nadama  
hindi mo na kaya mapapatawad pa  
patawad na  
at kung mahal mo pa ako  
ang puso ko'y pakinggan mo  
at maririnig sa bawat pagtibok  
tumatawag at nagmamahal sayo...  
  
repeat (ii stanza)  
repeat(chorus)  
  
di akalain na pagsisisihan ko  
bakit ngayon lang nadamang may pagtingin pala sayo...  
  
repeat(chorus)  
tumatawag at nagmamahal sayooohhhhhh....


I was watching the news tonight  
And all over the world  
People were singing and carrying signs  
All over the world  
Everybody walking hand in hand  
Through cities that I've been  
And though I'm not there tonight  
You know I'll be back again  
I'll be back again, I'll be back again  
I'm on a plane tonight for Germany  
And all over the world  
There are lots of people just like you and me  
All over the world  
Who know the bomb must never fall again  
All over the world  
And we must all learn how to live as friends  
All over the world  
All over the world, all over the world  
We are making the news tonight  
All over the world  
Because we know that what we do is right  
All over the world  
Everybody walking hand in hand  
All over the world  
Through the streets of Europe and Japan  
All over the world  
All over the world, all over the world

Traditional, arranged  
By Arlo Guthrie  
Come all you old time cowboys  
And listen to my song  
Please do not grow weary  
I'll not detain you long  
Concerning some wild cowboys  
Who did agree to go  
And spend the summer pleasant  
On the range of the buffalo.  
Well I found myself in Griffin  
In eighteen eighty-three  
When a man by the name of Creagho  
Come a'walkin' up to me  
Sayin "How do you do young fella  
And how'd you like to go  
And spend the summer pleasant  
On the range of the buffalo".  
Well me being out of work right then  
To that drover I did say  
"My goin' out on the buffalo range  
Depends upon the pay  
But if you pay good wages,  
Transportation to and fro  
I think I might go with you  
On the range of the Buffalo".  
Well yes I pay good wages  
And transportation too  
If you'll agree to work for me  
Until the season's through  
But if you do get homesick  
And you try and run away  
You'll starve to death out on the trail  
And you'll also lose your pay  
Well with all the flatterin' talkin'  
He signed up quite a train  
Some ten or twelve in number  
Of able bodied men  
And our trip it was a pleasant one  
Through all New Mexico  
Until we crossed Pease River  
On the range of the buffalo  
It was there our pleasures ended  
And our troubles all begun  
A lightnin' storm come up on us  
And made the cattle run  
We got full of the stickers  
On the cactus that did grow  
And the outlaws waited to pick us off  
In the hills of Mexico  
Well the working season ended  
But the drover would not pay  
He said "You spent your money boys  
You're all in debt to me".  
But the cowboys never put much stock  
In a thing like a bankrupt law  
So we left the bastard's bones to bleach  
On the range of the buffalo.  
  


Children of Abraham, what's your story?  
Killing each other for a piece of land  
Children of Abraham, this ain't glory  
You've got to walk together hand in hand  
  
Take down the flags that just separate the people  
Take down the wire on the boundary  
Take back the words that were spoken in anger  
You've got to live just like a family  
  
Children of Abraham,I must be dreaming  
Rivers of blood running through your hands  
Children crying, mothers screaming  
It just wasn't looking like the Promised Land


Coming in from London from over the pole  
Flyin' in a big jet liner  
Chicks are flyin' everywhere around the plane  
Could we ever feel much finer?

Don't touch my bags if you please mister customs man

Walkin' in the hall with his things and all  
Smilin, said he was the lone ranger

Bringin' in a couple of keys  
Don't touch my bags if you please mister customs man

This morning I woke up alone  
I spent the day time on my own  
Lots of people have come and gone  
To hear a cowboy sing an old time song  
Oh babe, I love you so  
This here is the only thing I know  
It ain't right and it ain't wrong  
To hear a cowboy sing an old time song  
Last night I sat till closing time  
Thinking of the things that crossed my mind  
You were the one I was thinking of  
I guess it must be that I'm just in love  
Oh babe, I love you so  
This here is the only thing I know  
It ain't right, it ain't wrong  
To hear a cowboy sing an old time song  
I hope they play this song of mine  
On the jukebox for a dime  
Then if you leave 'cause something's wrong  
You'll hear your cowboy sing an old time song  
Oh babe, I love you so  
This here is the only thing I know  
It ain't right and it ain't wrong  
To hear a cowboy sing an old time song  
To hear a cowboy sing an old time song

Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
I remember when I met you  
Underneath the evening sky  
Now it seems I could forget you  
Rescue me, I'm bound to die  
All the promises we made there  
With no words to understand  
And though I've tried I've come up empty  
Heart of stone, drowning man  
CHORUS:  
I'm going down for the third time  
And I need a helping hand  
The rooster crows and I'm sinking  
Heart of stone, drowning man  
Where are you, my dear companion  
How much longer must you be  
I'm all alone out on the ocean  
When will you come and rescue me  
It's too late for new beginnings  
In this world I've left behind  
There is nothing left worth keeping  
Not a thing to change my mind  
CHORUS  
How far down the road to glory  
Must we go without a sign  
Caught out on these stormy waters  
How can you treat me so unkind  
Did you know from the beginning  
That I'd dig this lousy hole  
Oh, don't leave me here abandoned  
In this dark night of the soul  
CHORUS  
  


Gonna sit right here and sing myself a tune  
That I wrote one afternoon after everyone had gone  
And I know that this won't mean a lot to you  
You've got better things to do but for me I'll just go on  
Old dog is lying in the middle of the road  
He don't do nothing 'cause he don't want to  
And I think I'm gonna like that hound  
'Cause the more he sits around, the less I want to do too  
Gonna sit right here and watch the world roll by  
Till we both just up and die watching clouds and eating flies  
Don't want to bother no one, don't want nothing here to change  
A dusty road is all we've ever dreamed of  
And I think I'm gonna love this life  
Maybe someday take a wife  
She can join us if she wants to  
Ain't nobody gonna tell what to do  
If a car comes we just move  
And we both move real smooth  
Like old dog is moving must be something in the air  
Some bitch is coming up the road now  
And I think I'm gonna like that hound  
'Cause the more he gets around, the more I want to do too  


I dream in the morning  
That she brings me water  
And I dream in evening  
That she brings me wine  
Just a poor man's daughter  
From Puerto Penasco  
Evangelina in old Mexico  
  
There's a great hot desert  
South of Mexicali  
And if you don't have water  
Then you better not go  
Tequila won't get you  
Across the desert  
To Evangelina in old Mexico  
  
And the fire I feel for the  
Woman I love  
Is driving me insane  
Knowing she's waiting  
And I just can't get there  
Lord only knows that I've  
Racked my brain  
To try and find a way  
To see that woman in old Mexico  
  
I met a kind man  
Who guarded the border  
He said you don't have papers  
But I'll let you go  
I can tell that you love her  
By the look in your eyes now  
She's the rose of the desert  
In old Mexico  
  
And the fire I feel for the  
Woman I love  
Is driving me insane  
Knowing she's waiting  
And I just can't get there  
Lord only knows that I've  
Racked my brain  
To try and find a way  
To see the woman in old Mexico  
  
And I dream in the morning  
That she brings me water  
And I dream in the evening  
That she brings me wine  
Just a poor man's daughter  
From Puerto Penasco  
Evangelina in old Mexico  
  
There's a great hot desert  
South of Mexicali  
And if you don't have water  
Then you better not go  
Tequila won't get you  
Across the desert  
To Evangelina in old Mexico  
  
She's the rose of the desert  
In old Mexico


Words and Music Arlo Guthrie  
Every hand in the land  
Shakes along with me  
It don't seem that I can dream  
Like I used to dream  
Maybe that somebody is shaking me  
If I fell I could tell  
It may be that somebody is making me  
Dream that you're forever  
Gone away from me  
Every toe that I know  
Step away with me  
I can't seem to get where  
I want to be  
Maybe it's my own foot  
That keeps tripping me  
Trip trap - flip flap  
It must come to wherever from it comes  
Through to me  
I can't walk to where  
My own dreams talk to me  
Every face in this place  
Take your eyes away  
Blink if you think that  
There's another way  
Maybe it's my own eyes  
That don't see the way  
The time is blind  
It may come to pass  
That I will lose my mind  
I can't live without the love I left behind  
I can't live without the love I left behind  
  


Of war and peace the truth just twists, its curfew gull it glides  
Upon four legged forest clouds the cowboy angel rides  
With his candle lit into the sun though it's glow is waxed in black  
All except beneath the trees of Eden  
The lamp post stands with folded arms its iron claws attached  
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail  
Through its shadow's metal badge  
All in all can only fall with a crashing but meaningless blow  
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden  
The savage soldier sticks his head in the sand and then complains  
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf but still remains  
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay at ships with tattooed sails  
Heading for the Gates of Eden  
The time rusted compass blade, Aladdin and his lamp  
Sits with Utopian hermit monks, side saddle on the Golden Calf  
And on their promises of paradise you will not hear a laugh  
All except inside the Gates of Eden  
Relationships of ownership they whisper in the wings  
To those condemned to act accordingly and wait for succeeding kings  
And I try to harmonize with songs the lonesome sparrow sings  
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden  
The motorcycle 'Black Madonna', two-wheeled gypsy queen  
And her silver-studded phantom cause the gray flannel dwarf to scream  
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey, pick up on his bread crumb sins  
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden  
The kingdoms of experience in the precious winds they rot  
While paupers change possessions  
Each one wishing for what the other has got  
And the princess and the prince discuss what's real and what's not  
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden  
The foreign sun it squints upon a bed that is never mine  
As friends and others, strangers from their fates try to resign  
Leaving men holy and totally free to do anything they wish to do but die  
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden  
At dawn my lover comes to me and tells me of her dreams  
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse  
Into the ditch of what each one means  
At times I think there are no words but these to tell what's true  
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden  


o to sleep you weary hobo  
Let the towns drift slowly by  
Can't you hear the steel rail humming  
That's a hobo's lullaby  
  
Do not think about tomorrow  
Let tomorrow come and go  
Tonight you're in a nice warm boxcar  
Safe from all the wind and snow  
  
I know the police cause you trouble  
They cause trouble everywhere  
But when you die and go to heaven  
You won't find no policemen there  
  
I know your clothes are torn and ragged  
And your hair is turning grey  
Lift your head and smile at trouble  
You'll find happiness some day  
  
So go to sleep you weary hobo  
Let the towns drift slowly by  
Don't you feel the steel rail humming  
That's a hobo's lullaby


I ride an old paint, I lead an old dan  
I'm goin' to Montana to throw the hoolihan  
They feed in the coulees, they water in the draw  
Their tails are all matted, their backs are all raw  
  
Chorus:  
Ride around little dogies, ride around them slow  
For the fiery and snuffy are rarin' to go  
  
Old Bill Jones had a daughter and a son  
One went to college, the other went wrong  
His wife, she got killed in a poolroom fight  
But still he's a-singin' from mornin' till night  
  
Chorus  
  
When I die, take my saddle from the wall  
Place it on my old pony, lead him out of his stall  
Tie my bones to my saddle and turn our faces to the West  
And we'll ride the prairie we love the best  
  
Chorus  
  
I ride an old paint, I lead an old dan  
I'm goin' to Montana to throw the hoolihan  
They feed in the coulees, they water in the draw  
Their tails are all matted, and their backs are all raw  
  
Chorus


We are climbing Jacob's ladder  
We are climbing Jacob's ladder  
We are climbing Jacob's ladder  
Brothers, sisters, all  
  
Every rung goes higher and higher  
Every rung goes higher and higher  
Every rung goes higher and higher  
Brothers, sisters, all  
  
We are dancing Sarah's circle  
We are dancing Sarah's circle  
We are dancing Sarah's circle  
Sisters, brothers, all  
  
Every round a generation  
Every round a generation  
Every round a generation  
Sisters, brothers, all  
  
We are climbing Jacob's ladder  
We are climbing Jacob's ladder  
We are climbing Jacob's ladder  
Brothers, sisters, all


Down the way where the nights are gay  
And the sun shines daily on the mountain top  
I took a trip on a sailing ship  
And when I reached Jamaica I made a stop  
  
[CHORUS:]  
But I'm sad to say, I'm on my way  
Won't be back for many a day  
My heart is down, my head is turning around  
I had to leave a little girl in Kingston town  
  
Sounds of laughter everywhere  
And the dancing girls swaying to and fro  
I must declare that my heart is there  
Though I've been from Maine to Mexico  
  
[CHORUS]  
Down at the market you can hear  
Ladies cry out while on their head they bear  
Ackie rice and salt fish is nice  
And the rum is good any time of year  
  
[CHORUS]  
[CHORUS]


[CHORUS:]  
Lying on the side of the road  
Feeling like he heard a sound  
Shivered with the feelin' that he knowed  
John looked down, John looked down  
John looked down the long, long road  
  
She gave John a present that was fine  
So fine that he had to go  
Went to see what it was that he knowed  
John looked down, John looked down  
John looked down the long, long road  
  
And I know it's hard  
But what did you expect of her?  
John looked down  
  
If you see the lady in your mind  
Even in her nothingness  
Standing through the darkest night  
And the people want to fight  
But first ask if it's all right  
John looked down, John looked down  
John looked down the long, long road  
  
[CHORUS]  
And I know it's hard  
But what did you expect of her?  
John looked down


Words and music by Ed McCurdy  
Last night I had the strangest dream  
I'd ever dreamed before  
I dreamed the world had all agreed  
To put an end to war  
I dreamed I saw a mighty room  
Filled with women and men  
And the paper they were signing said  
They'd never fight again  
And when the paper was all signed  
And a million copies made  
They all joined hands and bowed their heads  
And grateful pray'rs were prayed  
And the people in the streets below  
Were dancing 'round and 'round  
While swords and guns and uniforms  
Were scattered on the ground  
Last night I had the strangest dream  
I'd never dreamed before  
I dreamed the world had all agreed  
To put an end to war.  
  


Lonely sunshine, days come easy,  
Spend my time alone at rest,  
And if I were the last to leave here,  
Now would these roads be any less?  
  
Oh, I'm the last to leave.  
Now would these ribbon highway roads  
Be less wonderful to me?  
Why must I always be so slow?  
  
Many friends come and go,  
You know there's a lot of feelings that I've left behind,  
And it's a lonely world, I know,  
When your friends are hard to find.  
  
But take the time, my memory fails,  
And soak my eyes in the morning rain,  
Like a sailor, sailing over Jordan,  
On the road back home again.  
  
Oh, I'm the last to leave.  
Would these ribbon highway roads  
Be less wonderful to me?  
Why must I always be so slow?


I want to hop on the last train in the station  
Won't need to get yourself prepared  
When you're on that last train for glory  
You'll know you're reasonably there  
  
Maybe you ain't walked on any highway  
You've just been flyin' in the air  
But if you're on that last train to glory  
You'll know you must have paid your fare  
  
Maybe you've been lying down in the jailhouse  
Maybe you are hungry and poor  
Maybe your ticket on the last train to glory  
Is the stranger who is sleeping on your floor  
  
I ain't a man of constant sorrow  
I ain't seen trouble all day long  
We are only passengers on the last train to glory  
That will soon be long, long gone  
  
I want to hop on the last train in the station  
Won't need to get yourself prepared  
When you're on the last train to glory  
You'll know you're reasonably there


  
CHORUS:  
LAY DOWN, LITTLE DOGGIES, LAY DOWN  
WE'VE BOTH GOT TO SLEEP ON THE COLD, COLD GROUND  
THE WINDS BLOWIN' COLDER AND THE SUN'S GOIN' DOWN  
LAY DOWN, LITTLE DOGGIES, LAY DOWN  
WE HIT THIS OLD BEEF TRAIL JUST TWO MONTHS AGO  
WE BLISTERED IN THE SUN AND WE FROZE IN THE SNOW  
IN TEN DAYS WE'RE COMIN TO A PACKING HOUSETOWN  
SO LAY YOURSELVES DOWN, LITTLE DOGGIES, LAY DOWN  
THIS DODGE CITY TRAIL SHE'S A HARD ROAD TO GO  
UP THE TEXAS FLATLANDS THROUGH OLD MEXICO  
I GOT DUST IN MY EYES AND MUD IN MY NOSE  
SO LAY YOURSELVES DOWN, LITTLE DOGGIES, LAY DOWN  
CHORUS  
THAT BAD HOLE OF WATER WE DRUNK AND GOT SICK  
CURLED UP OUT HAIR, TIED OUR TAILS BACK IN KINKS  
WE GOT LOST IN A BLIND CANYON, TIPPY-TOEIN' AROUND  
SO LAY YOURSELVES DOWN, LITTLE DOGGIES, LAY DOWN  
HERE NOW WE COME TO THE END OF OUR TRAIL  
YOUR HAIR, HIDE AND CARCASS TO THE STOCKYARDS I SELL  
I'LL SEE YOU IN A TIN CAN WHEN YOU GET SHIPPED AROUND  
SO LAY YOURSELVES DOWN, LITTLE DOGGIES, LAY DOWN  
CHORUS  
  


Coming down the highway, running like a wind  
Gonna beat the sunset to the coast and back again  
Moving through the shadows, almost going blind  
Living like a legend before my time  
If the road don't kill me, baby, I'll see you in the spring  
Making up for lost time between us seems like everything  
If I can make it home alright, you know, I'll treat you fine  
Living like a legend before my time  
I know, it wasn't easy for you, baby  
With your man out on the road  
So I'll be coming home tomorrow  
To try to help you carry the load  
I'm running out of highways and bridges to burn  
This kind of living is taking its toll on what I've learned  
You know, it ain't easy leaving you behind  
Living like a legend before my time  
But someday, baby, I'll be coming home to stay  
Wrapped up in your warm love every night and every day  
Ooh, I'm going out of my mind  
Living like a legend before my time  
I know, it wasn't easy for you, baby  
With your man out on the road  
So I'll be coming home tomorrow  
To try to help you carry the load  
I'll be getting up early 'cause I know, I'm coming home  
I'm so tired of living this legend life alone  
Kick off your shoes, babe, we'll drink a little wine  
Forget about living like a legend before my time  
Forget about living like a legend  
Just forget about the road  
So, look out for me, darling  
On account of your man is coming home  


Go and tell Lord Grenville that the tide is on the turn  
It's time to haul the anchor up and leave the land astern  
We'll be gone before the dawn returns  
Like voices onthe wind.  
  
Go and tell Lord Grenville that our dreams have run aground  
There's nothing here to keep us in this shanty town  
None of us are caring where we're bound  
Like voices on the wind.  
  
And come the day you'll hear them saying  
"They're throwing it all away"  
Nothing more to say  
Just throwing it all away.  
  
Go and fetch the captain's log and tear the pages out  
We're on our way to nowhere now, can't bring the helm about  
None of us are left in any doubt  
We won't be back again.  
  
Send a message to the fleet, they'll search for us in vain  
We won't be there among the reaches of the Spanish Main  
Tell the ones we left home not to wait  
We won't be back again.  
  
And come the day you'll hear them saying  
"They're throwing it all away"  
Nothing more to say  
Just throwing it all away.  
  
Our time is just a point along a line  
That runs forever with no end  
I never thought that we would come to find  
Ourselves upon these rocks again.  
  
Go and tell Lord Grenville that the tide is on the turn...


By Irving Mills and Cliff Friend  
  
I got a feelin' called the blues,  
Since my baby said good-bye  
Lawd I don't know what l'll do  
All I do is sit and sigh  
That last long day she said goodbye  
Well Lawd, I thought I would cry  
She'd do me, she'd do you,  
She's got that kind of lovin'  
Lawd, I love to hear her  
When she calls me sweet daddy  
  
Such a beautiful dream  
I hate to think it's all over  
I lost my heart it seems  
I've grown so used to you somehow  
But I'm nobody's sugar daddy now  
And I'm lonesome, I got the lovesick blues  
  
I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal  
That's what's the matter with me  
I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal  
But she don't care about me  
  
Lawd I tried and tried to keep her satisfied  
But she just wouldn't stay  
So now that she is leavin'  
This is all I say...


Words and music by Robb (Rabbitt) MacKay  
Some times when the sun goes down  
And I'm lost in some other town  
My thoughts may drift away  
To Manzanillo Bay  
And I can see a fisherman  
His day's catch Iying on the sand  
Underneath the palms that sway  
Over Manzanillo Bay  
CHORUS:  
Now I'm missing your silver moon  
Black sands and your blue lagoon  
Some day I would like to be  
Back next to your shining sea  
Drinking rum from a conch shell  
Caught up in your magic spell  
Some day I would like to go  
Back down to Mexico  
I remember your fields of cane  
Your warm breezes and jungle rains  
And watching the children play  
Over Manzanillo Bay  
And out in your market square  
The women sing out to sell their wares  
I've got fresh shrimp today  
From Manzanillo Bay  
CHORUS  
And under the spell of night  
The bay reflecting the harbor light  
You can hear the guitar play  
Over Manzanillo Bay  
And if you're thinking about romance  
And you're willing to take a chance  
Just pick any small cafe  
In Manzanillo Bay  
CHORUS  
Some times when the sun goes down  
And I'm lost in some other town  
My thoughts may drift away  
To Manzanillo Bay  
  
  


Like a dream in the night  
As the snow settles white  
There's a fire burning bright  
In Massachusetts  
And there's a house upon a hill  
That keeps us from the chill  
And by the grace of God  
We will be in Massachusetts  
You can tell me about the times you spent  
In the Rockies and on the plains  
Please don't think that I'm the last to say  
That there ain't lots of other places  
In this world that still remain  
Beautiful and unchanged  
But they're just not the same  
The sun comes up to meet the dawn  
And there's a day that must go on  
There's another night that's gone  
In Massachusetts  
And I could spend all of my days  
And remain each day amazed  
At the way each day is phrased  
In Massachusetts  
You can tell me about the times you spent  
In the Rockies and on the plains  
Please don't think that I'm the last to say  
That there ain't lots of other places  
In this world that still remain  
Beautiful and unchanged  
But they're just not the same  
Now if you could only see  
I know you would agree  
There ain't nowhere else to be  
Like Massachusetts  
And there's a house upon a hill  
That keeps us from the chill  
And by the grace of God  
We will be in Massachusetts  
Come on tell me about the time you spent  
In the Rockies and on the plains  
And please don't think that I'm the last to say  
That there ain't lots of other places  
In this world that still remain  
Beautiful and unchanged  
But they're just not the same as Massachusetts  


I'm growing tired of the big city lights  
Tired of the glamor, tired of the sights  
In all my dreams, I am roaming once more  
Back to my home on the old river shore  
I am sad and weary far away from home  
Miss the Mississippi and you dear  
Days are dark and dreary everywhere I roam  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Roaming the wide world over  
Always along and blue, so blue  
Nothing seems to cheer me under heaven's dome  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Memories are bringing happy days of yore  
Miss the Mississippi and you dear  
Mocking birds are singing 'round the cabin door  
Miss the Mississippi and you  
Roaming the wide world over  
Always alone and blue  
Longing form my homeland, muddy water shore  
Miss the Mississippi and you  


Words and music by James Rider  
  
Just me and a friend roamin' around  
Him a magician and I was a clown  
Playin' the streets for a dollar a day  
Waitin' for the right time and a sign to lead the way  
  
Crossed over the border to a mystical land  
Sort of unexpected didn't quite understand  
On a razor's edge on a grain of sand  
Onward we wandered to the gates of oblivion  
  
On a roll of the dice we headed out west  
Where the sage and and the spice attracted us  
Shadows fell down like a dark groping hand  
Saw the teeth of the wolves and the blood of the lambs  
  
On a turn of the cards I lightened my load  
Throwing off fear for the weakness it holds  
On target and calm the vision was clear  
Beyond the mirage I took for granted was here  
  
On a flip of the coins we rode the coast  
Tryin' to make the most of every situation  
That we witnessed near at hand  
On a drifter's crusade all over the land  
  
Could it be in the stars in the passing of cars  
At a table in the bar in a turn of the cards  
In a change of your mind in the passing of time  
In a ribbon of rhyme just down the line  
  
Just me and a friend roamin' around  
Him a magician I was a clown  
Playin' the streets for a dollar a day  
Waitin' for the right time and a sign to lead the way


Hello again the mornin' dawn has burned away  
The midnight mist  
Now and then I feel so fine  
And now and then I don't feel lonely  
Now and then and only in my mind  
  
I want to go outside today go away, I think I'll stay  
Now and then I talk with you  
And now and then you turn me on  
Now and then and when I don't feel blue  
  
Maybe I could tell you now that I really love you  
Pleased to understand that you are there, in the air  
Now and then you turn me on  
Now and then you must be gone  
Now and then I said  
Say so long, now and forever then


Many a month has come and gone  
Since I've wandered from my home  
In those Oklahoma hills  
Where I was born  
  
Many a page of my life has turned  
Many lessons I have learned  
And I feel like in those hills  
Where I belong  
  
Way down yonder in the Indian nation  
Ridin' my pony on the reservation  
In the Oklahoma hills where I was born  
  
Way down yonder in the Indian nation  
A cowboy's life is my occupation  
In the Oklahoma Hills where I was born  
  
But as I sit here today  
Many mile's I am away  
From the place I rode my pony  
Through the draw  
  
Where the oak and black-jack trees  
Kiss the playful prairie breeze  
And I feel back in those hills  
Where I belong  
  
Now as I turn life a page  
To the land of the great Osage  
In those Oklahoma hills  
Where I was born  
  
Where the black oil rolls and flows  
And the snow white cotton grows  
And I feel like in those hills  
Where I belong


Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
Living now here but for fortune  
Placed by fate's mysterious schemes  
Who'd believe that we're the ones asked  
To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams  
Arise sweet destiny, time runs short  
All of your patience has heard their retort  
Hear us now for alone we can't seem  
To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams  
Can you hear the words being whispered  
All along the American stream  
Tyrants freed the just are imprisoned  
Try to rekindle the patriot's dreams  
Ah but perhaps too much is being asked of too few  
You and your children with nothing to do  
Hear us now for alone we can't seem  
To try to rekindle the patriot's dreams  
  
  


Bad news, bad news, come to me where I sleep  
Turn, turn, turn again  
Sayin' one of my friends is in trouble deep  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
Tell me the trouble, tell me once to my ears  
Turn, turn, turn again  
Juliet prison for ninety-nine years  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
A crash on the highway threw a car into a field  
Turn, turn, turn again  
There were four people killed and he was at the wheel  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
But I knew him as well as I know my own self  
Turn, turn, turn again  
And he wouldn't harm a life that belonged to someone else  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
That may be so said the judge from the side of his mouth  
Turn, turn, turn again  
But the witness who saw it, he left little doubt  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
He may, he may have a sentence to server  
Turn, turn, turn again  
But ninety-nine years, he just does not deserve  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
Too late, too late, for his case it is sealed  
Turn, turn, turn again  
A sentence, it is passed and it can not be repealed  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
But he ain't no criminal and his crime it is none  
Turn, turn, turn again  
And what happened to him could have happened to anyone  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
At that the judge jumped forward and his face it did freeze  
Turn, turn, turn again  
Sayin', ?Would you kindly leave my office now, please?  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
I squinted my eyes and I stood up slow  
Turn, turn, turn again  
With no other choice except for me to go  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
I walked down the hall and I heard his door slam  
Turn, turn, turn again  
I walked down the stairs but I did not understand  
Turn, turn to the wind and the rain  
And I played my guitar through the night and through the day  
Turn, turn, turn again  
But the only tune that my guitar would play  
Was oh how cruel, the wind and the rain  


by T-Bone Burnett  
The power of love can make a blind man see  
Can bring a man to his knees  
  
The power of love can make a sultan grieve  
Can make a skeptic believe  
  
[CHORUS:  
The power of love is south of south  
And scorches out all the doubt  
  
The power of love is the name of names  
And burns away all the pain  
  
The power of love can make a gangster cry  
Can make a loser try  
  
The power of love can make a strong man weak  
Can make a bigot meek  
  
[CHORUS]  
The power of love can make a coward brave  
Can make a hero afraid  
  
The power of love can make a miser give  
Can make a dead man live  
  
[CHORUS]  
[CHORUS]


Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
In the event of my demise  
Be sure to include this statement  
When you are bent on closing my eyes  
Thinking about what my life meant  
Alone on a hill back in '65  
Things looked a lot like changing  
Singing our songs that we harmonized  
Dreaming of worlds rearranging  
And I don't know why I'm singing tonight  
Maybe it's time someone told you  
Just because you say you've seen the light  
Doesn't mean nobody sold you  
I can remember all of your smiles  
During the demonstrations  
Taking on what seemed like the whole world  
Igniting the hearts of our nations  
And together we sang our victory songs  
Though we were worlds apart  
Every thing then has now passed away  
Except for the love in my heart  
Sitting at home on computerized beds  
Tryine to come to conclusions  
Seeing reflections from rose-colored heads  
Ignoring the states of illusion  
Drunk in a world of material wealth  
No one can notice you falling  
Fantastic flights once good tor your health  
Now make you deaf to your calling  
And all alone the prophet groans  
With words as yet unseen  
Who'll be awake when the master returns  
Who will be lost in their dreams  
So in the event of my demise  
8e sure to include this statement  
Only the words of love kept alive  
Are worthy of not being wasted  
  
  


When evening chores are over at the ranch house on the plains  
And there's nothing left to do but lay around  
I saddle up my pony and go riding down the trail  
Just to watch the desert sun go down  
  
White faced cattle lowing, sagebrush everywhere  
Granite spires are standing all around  
I'll tell you folks it's heaven to go ridin' down the trail  
Just to watch the desert sun go down  
  
Ridin' down the canyon to watch the sun go down  
A picture that no artist 'ere could paint  
Cactus plants are bloomin' on the mountain side  
I hear a coyote calling to its mate  
  
White faced cattle lowing, sagebrush everywhere  
Granite spires are standing all around  
I'll tell you folks it's heaven to go ridin' down the trail  
Just to watch the desert sun go down  
  
White faced cattle lowing, sagebrush everywhere

Granite spires are standing all around  
I'll tell you folks it's heaven to go ridin' down the trail  
Just to watch the desert sun go down


Words and music by Pete Seeger  
Sailng down my golden river  
Sun and water all my own  
Yet I was never alone  
Sun and water, old life givers  
L'll have them where ere I roam  
And I was not far from home  
Sunlight glancing on the water  
Life and death are all my own  
Yet I was never alone  
Life for all my sons and daughters  
Golden sparkles in the foam  
And I was not far from home  
Sailing down this winding highway  
Travelers from near and far  
And I was never alone  
Exploring all the little byways  
Sighting all the distant stars  
And I was not far from home  
Sailing down my golden river  
Sun and water all my own  
Yet I was never alone  
Sun and water, old life givers  
L'll have them where ere I roam  
And I was not far from home  
Yet I was never alone  
And I was not far from home  
  


The Missouri, she's a might riverAway you rolling river  
The red man's camp lies on her bordersAway, we're bound away across the wide  
Missouri, a white man loved an Indian maidenAway you rolling river  
With notions sweet his canoe was ladenAway, we're bound away across the wide  
  
Missouri Shenandoah, I love your daughterAway you rolling river  
I'll take her 'cross the rolling waterAway, we're bound away across the wide  
Missouri, the chief disdained the trader's dollarsAway you rolling river  
My daughter never you shall followAway, we're bound away across the
wideMissouri  
  
At last there came a Yankee skipperAway you rolling river  
He winked his eye, and he tipped his flipper  
Away, we're bound away across the wideMissouriHe sold the chief that fire-

Away you rolling river and 'cross the river he stole his daughter  
  
Away, we're bound away across the wideMissouriO Shenandoah, I long to hear you  
Away you rolling riverAcross the wide and rolling water  
Away, we're bound away across the wideMissouri


I've been to wild Montana  
I went there in a storm  
My boots were Texas leather  
My Levis wet and torn  
  
I loved it in Montana  
Loved it in the storm  
I think I'm gonna cross that river  
I just might be reborn  
  
New York, New York, winter, '61  
Takin' me a city ride  
Somebody tall musta put out the lights  
'Cause it got real dark outside  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I never saw the sun till '71  
But I never gave up the fight  
I sure was glad when I saw the dawn  
Somebody, somebody turned on the light  
Somebody turned on the light  
  
Women, wine, and fast red cars  
And I couldn't seem to read the signs  
Somebody said, "Whose life is this?"  
And I said that it can't be mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When the world is wrong, better right yourself  
It'll make the dark clouds fly  
Nobody tall can put out the lights  
Just don't let the spirit die  
  
If you never see the sun till '91  
Don't you ever give up the fight  
Sure be glad when you see the dawn  
Somebody, somebody turns on the light  
Somebody turns on the light


Someday I'll be there with you  
When you're there, I'll be there too  
If you only knew  
I will be with you  
Someday we will meet again  
When we meet, I'll see you then  
If you only knew  
I'll be there with you  
It will make this farewell seem  
Little more than but a dream  
If you only knew  
Dreams are often true  
Someday I'll be there with you  
When you're there, I'll be there too  
If you only knew  
I'll be there with you  
Someday when we meet again  
When we meet our sorrows end  
If you only knew  


Every morning just as soon as it's light  
Get out of bed and I'm feeling alright  
Make me some coffee and I sit down alone  
The rest of the day I'm on the telephone  
Hang up, hold on  
You got a dime so you come on so strong  
Save your money and let me be  
Hang up the phone and quit bothering me  
I got a phone in my bedroom and one in the barn  
A phone in my car and one in the yard  
A phone on my saddle for when I'm out on the range  
A phone in my pocket for when I'm down at the grange  
Hang up, hold on  
You got a dime so you come on so strong  
Save your money and let me be  
Hang up the phone and quit bothering me  
Now with devaluation all over the land  
The whole wide world has got more money in their hand  
They'll be calling me up from Peking and Nome  
I'm going to rip out my telephone  


I struck the trail in seventy-nine  
The herd strung out behind me  
As I jogged along my mind went back  
To the gal I left behind  
If I ever get off the trail, boys  
And the Indians don't find me  
I'll make my way straight back again  
To the gal I left behind me  
That sweet little gal, that true little gal  
The gal I left behind me  
That sweet little gal, that pretty little gal  
The gal I left behind me  
The wind did blow and the rain did flow  
The hail did fall and blind me  
And I thought of that gal, that sweet little gal  
That gal I'd left behind me  
She wrote ahead to a place I said  
And I was glad to find it  
She says "I'm true, when you get through  
Ride back and you will find me"  
That sweet little gal, that true little gal  
The gal I left behind me  
That sweet little gal, that pretty little gal  
The gal I left behind me  
When we sold out I took the train  
I knew that I would find her  
When I got back, we had a smack  
And that's no gol-darned liar  
That sweet little gal, that true little gal  
The gal I left behind me  
That sweet little gal, that pretty little gal  
The gal I left behind me  


[Chorus]  
I don't want a pickle  
Just want to ride on my motorcycle  
And I don't want a tickle  
'Cause I'd rather ride on my motorcycle  
And I don't want to die  
I just want to ride on my motorcycle  
  
It was late last night the other day  
I thought I'd go up and see Ray  
So l went up and I saw Ray  
There was only one thing Ray could say, was:  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just last week I was on my bike  
I run into a friend named Mike  
Run into my friend named Mike  
Mike no longer has a bike. He cries:

Chorus  
  
This song is about the time that I was ridin' my motorcycle.  
Going down a mountain road, at 150 miles an hour, playin'  
My guitar. On one side of the mountain road there was a  
Mountain, and on the other side there was nothin' - there was  
A cliff in the air.  
  
Now, when you're going down a mountain road at I50 miles  
An hour you gotta be very careful, especially if you're playin'  
A guitar. Especially if that guitar is an acoustic guitar.  
Because if it's an acoustic guitar, the wind pressure is greater  
On the box side than on the neck side, because there's  
More guitar on the box side. I wasn't payin' attention..  
  
Luckily I didn't go into the mountain - I went over the cliff.  
I was goin' at 150 miles an hour sideways and 500 feet down  
At the same time.  
  
I knew it was the end. I looked down, I said ''Wow! Some  
Trip". I thought it... Well I knew it was... I knew it was my last  
Trip, and in my last remaining seconds in world, I decided  
To write one last farewell song to the world.  
  
Put a new ink cartridge in my pen. Took out a piece of paper.  
I sat back and I thought awhile. Then I started writin':  
I don't want a pickle  
Just want to ride on my motorsickle  
And I don't want a tickle  
'Cause I'd rather ride on my motorsickle  
  
And I don't want to die  
Just want to ride on my motorcy... Cle. "  
  
I knew that, it wasn't the best song l ever wrote, but I didn't  
Have time to change it. I was comin' down mighty fast.  
  
But as you all know, and as fate would have it, I didn't die. I  
Landed on the top of a police car. And he died. I drove away  
On the road that he was on. I came into town at a screamin'  
175 miles an hour, playin' the motorcycle song.  
  
I came into town, I jumped off my bike, the bike went around  
The corner by itself, went up on the stand by itself, turned  
Itself off.  
  
I walked over to my friend. He was standin' there eatin'  
Pickles. I said "Hi, what's happenin'?" He looked at me in the  
Eye and said "Nothin'".  
  
You gotta sing it with that kind of enthusiasm. Like you just  
Squashed a cop...  
  
Chorus


This next song we're going to dedicate to a great American  
Organization. Tonight I'd like to dedicate this to our boys  
In the FBI.  
  
Well, wait a minute. It's hard to be an FBI man. I mean, first  
Of all, being an FBI man, you have to be over 40 years old.  
And the reason is that it takes at least 25 years with the  
Organization to be that much of a bastard. It's true. You just  
Can't join, you know. It needs an atmosphere where your  
Natural bastardness can grow and develop and take a  
Meaningful shape in today's complex society.  
  
But that's not why I want to dedicate the song to the FBI. I  
Mean, the job that they have to do is a drag. I mean, they have  
To follow people around, you know. That's part of their job.  
Follow me around.  
  
I'm out on the highway and I'm drivin' down the road and I  
Run out of gasoline. I pull over to the side of the road. They  
Gotta pull over too - make believe that they ran out, you  
Know.  
  
I go to get some gasoline. They have to figure out whether  
They should stick with the car or follow me. Suppose I don't  
Come back and they're stayin' with the car.  
  
Or if I fly on the airplanes, I could fly half fare because I'm 12  
To 22. And they gotta pay the full fare. But the thing is that  
When you pay the full fare, you have to get on the airplane  
First, so that they know how many seats are left over for the  
Half fare kids. Right? And sometimes there aren't any seats  
Left over, and sometimes there are, but that doesn't mean that  
You have to go.  
  
Suppose that he gets on and fills up the last seat, so you can't  
Get on. Then he gets off then you can get on. What's he gonna  
Do?  
  
Well, it's a drag for him. But that


As I walked out in the streets of Laredo  
As I walked out in Laredo one day  
I spied a poor cowboy wrapped up in white linen  
All wrapped in white linen as cold as the clay  
  
""I see by your outfit that you are a cowboy""  
These words he did say as I proudly stepped by  
""Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story  
I'm shot in the breast and I know I must die  
  
""'Twas once in the saddle I used to go ridin'  
Once in the saddle I used to go gay  
First lead to drinkin', and then to card-playing  
I'm shot in the breast and I'm dying today  
  
""Let six jolly cowboys come carry my coffin  
Let six pretty gals come to carry my pall  
Throw bunches of roses all over my coffin  
Throw roses to deaden the clods as they fall  
  
""Oh, beat the drum slowly, and play the fife lowly  
And play the dead march as you carry me along  
Take me to the green valley and lay the earth o'er me  
For I'm a poor cowboy and I know I've done wrong""  
  
We beat the drum slowly and played the fife lowly  
And bitterly wept as we carried him along  
For we all loved our comrade, so brave, young and handsome  
We all loved our comrade although he done wrong

Chorus:  
This land is your land, this land is my land  
From California, to the New York Island  
From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters  
This land was made for you and me  
  
As I was walking a ribbon of highway  
I saw above me an endless skyway  
I saw below me a golden valley  
This land was made for you and me  
  
Chorus  
  
I've roamed and rambled and I've followed my footsteps  
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts  
And all around me a voice was sounding  
This land was made for you and me  
  
Chorus  
  
The sun comes shining as I was strolling  
The wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling  
The fog was lifting a voice come chanting  
This land was made for you and me  
  
Chorus  
  
As I was walkin' - I saw a sign there  
And that sign said - no tress passin'  
But on the other side.... It didn't say nothin!  
Now that side was made for you and me!  
  
Chorus  
  
In the squares of the city - In the shadow of the steeple  
Near the relief office - I see my people  
And some are grumblin' and some are wonderin'  
If this land's still made for you and me.  
  
Chorus (2x)


There's gonna be some changin' 'round  
Babe, when you come turn me down  
Trifled on me for your last time  
When I come home at night  
Why you always start a fight?  
Now, babe I want you to know  
You left your motor runnin' slow  
I got off and got on a faster line  
Got me a baby that's got some dough  
When you gotta go, you gotta go  
Gonna leave you and ease  
This troubled mind of mine  
There's no need to talk to you  
'Cause you know that we are through  
I can find a better place to spend my time  
Now if I stay out late  
You know I'm swingin' on another gate  
Gonna leave you and ease this  
Troubled mind of mine  
Now baby I want you to know  
You left your motor runnin' slow  
I got off and got on a faster line  
Got me a baby that's got some sense  
Gonna leave you to ease this  
Troubled mind of mine  
There's no need to talk to you  
'Cause you know that we are through  
I can find a better place to spend my time  
Now if I stay out late  
You know I'm swingin' on another gate  
Gonna leave you and ease this  
Troubled mind of mine  


I saw the splendor of the moonlight  
On Honolulu Bay  
There's something tender in the moonlight  
On Honolulu Bay  
  
And all the beaches are filled with peaches  
Who bring their ukes along  
And in the glimmer of the moonlight  
They love to sing this song  
  
1:  
If you like Ukulele Lady  
Ukulele Lady like a'you  
If you like to linger where it's shady  
Ukulele Lady linger too  
If you kiss Ukulele Lady  
While you promise ever to be true  
And she sees another Ukulele  
Lady foolin' 'round with you  
  
2:  
Maybe she'll sigh (an awful lot)  
Maybe she'll cry (and maybe not)  
Maybe she'll find somebody else  
By and by  
To sing to when it's cool and shady  
Where the tricky wicky wacky woo  
If you like Ukulele Lady  
Ukulele Lady like a'you  
  
She used to sing to me by moonlight  
On Honolulu Bay  
Fond memories cling to me by moonlight  
Although I'm far away  
  
Some day I'm going, where eyes are glowing  
And lips are made to kiss  
To see somebody in the moonlight  
And hear the song I miss


Uncle Jeff played the fiddle in his Colorado home  
And I backed him on the banjo so he didn't play alone  
We've got five generations of a fiddle playin' clan  
And it's nice to hear a fiddle by a fiddle playin' man  
  
Here's another song for Uncle Jeff Guthrie  
Written on the road by the light of the moon  
Thinkin' 'bout fiddlin' somewhere up in Michigan  
I hope that I can make it back to Colorado soon  
  
Well, my daddy had a fiddle, and he laid it on his son  
Sayin', "Son, play the fiddle like your fiddlin' folks done."  
Well, it's hard to learn to fiddle  
When you're fiddlin' on the run  
But fiddlin' is fiddlin', and fiddlin' is fun


Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
  
Truth is you've been waiting so long  
You're ripe and so insane  
Can the tentacles of your mind stop the pain  
  
How long will you sit there wondering  
What's happening to your heart  
Can't you fell the love surround you - That's a start  
  
Chorus:  
I'll take to the road in a little while  
Under cover of night  
You come or you stay  
Whatever seems right  
  
I ain't looking for friends or lovers  
Ain't looking for a pot of gold  
Had it all when I was younger - It got old  
  
Who will leave this world of sorrow  
Who will die to all the fears  
Kowning I'll be gone tommorow - Gone for years  
  
Chorus  
  
Somewhere the sun's just rising  
And the road comes in to view  
There's a wanderer freed from dying - Could be you  
  
Who will pay the price for freedom  
Learn the disciplines of the road  
Many tried but few succeed - So I'm told


Words and music by Robb (Rabbitt) MacKay  
Now there's a new craze a-goin' 'round  
It's gettin' bigger in most every town  
From New York City out to Hollywood  
Got everybody in the neighborhood  
CHORUS:  
Down in the unemployment line  
You got yourself a place and I got mine  
We been here waitin' since the clock struck nine  
Down in the unemployment line  
Now every day you've got to fight the horde  
Just to read what's on the bulletin board  
When you go back and try and claim your space  
Some other sucker come and stole your place  
CHORUS  
I hope the people in the government  
Tell us how we're gonna pay the rent  
How we're gonna get enough to eat  
No that the workin' man is obsolete  
If things keep goin' like they seem they do  
Won't be long before they're down here too  
And they can be a part of this here mob  
Workin' nine to five to find a job  
CHORUS  
  


Arranged and adapted by Arlo Guthrie  
So you ask me my kind friend  
Why I am sad and still  
And why my brow is darkened  
Like the clouds upon the hill  
Rein in your ponies closer  
And I'll tell you all a tale  
Of Utah Carroll, partner  
And his last ride on the trail  
In a grave without a headstone  
Without a date or name  
My partner lies there silent  
In the land from which I came  
Long ago we rode together  
We'd ridden side by side  
I loved him like a brother  
And I wept when Utah died  
While riding up one morning  
And our work was almost done  
The cattle quickly started  
On a wild and maddening run  
The boss's little daughter  
Who was riding on that side  
Rushed in to stop the stampede  
It was there my partner died  
Lenore upon her pony  
Tried to turn the cattle right  
But her blanket slipped beneath her  
And she caught and held on tight  
When we all saw that red blanket  
Each cowboy held his breath  
For should her pony fail her  
None could save the girl from death  
When the cattle saw the blanket  
Almost dragging on the ground  
They were maddened in a moment  
And they charged with deafening sound  
The girl soon saw her danger  
And she turned her pony's face  
And bending in her saddle  
Tried the blanket to replace  
Just then she lost her balance  
In the front of that wild tide  
Carroll's voice controlled the round up  
"Lie still, Lenore" he cried  
And then close up beside her  
Came Utah riding fast  
But little did the poor boy know  
The ride would be his last  
Full often from the saddle  
He had caught the trailing rope  
To pick her up at full speed  
Was now his only hope  
He swung low from his saddle  
To take her to his arm  
We thought that he'd succeeded  
That the girl was safe from harm  
But such a strain upon his saddle  
Had ne'er been put before  
And the cinches gave beneath him  
And he fell beside Lenore  
When the girl fell from her saddle  
She had dragged the blanket down  
It lay there close beside them  
Where they lay upon the ground  
Utah took the blanket  
And to Lenore he said  
"Lie still" and quickly running  
Waved the red thing o'er his head  
He turned the maddened cattle  
From Lenore, his little friend  
And as the mighty herd rushed toward him  
He turned to met his end  
And as the herd came on him  
His weapon quickly drew  
He was bound to die defended  
As all brave cowboys do  
The weapon flashed like lightning  
And it sounded loud and clear  
As the cattle rushed and killed him  
He dropped the leading steer  
When I broke through that wide circle  
To where poor Utah lay  
With a thousand wounds and bruises  
His life blood ebbed away  
I knelt down close beside him  
And I knew that all was o'er  
As I heard him faintly whisper  
"Good-bye, my sweet Lenore"  
Next morning at the churchyard  
I heard the preacher say  
"Don't think our kind friend Utah  
Was lost on that great day  
He was a much-loved cowboy  
And not afraid to die  
And we'll meet him at the round up  
On the plains beyond the sky"  
So you ask me my kind friend  
Why I am sad and still  
And why my brow is darkened  
Like the clouds upon the hill  
Rein in your ponies closer  
And I'll tell you all a tale  
Of Utah Carroll, partner  
And his last ride on the trail  
  


Words by Adrian Mitchell, music by Arlo Guthrie  
Victor Jara of Chile  
Lived like a shooting star  
He fought for the people of Chile  
With his songs and his guitar  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
Victor Jara was a peasant  
He worked from a few years old  
He sat upon his father's plow  
And watched the earth unfold  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
Now when the neighbors had a wedding  
Or one of their children died  
His mother sang all night for them  
With Victor by her side  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
He grew up to be a fighter  
Against the people's wrongs  
He listened to their grief and joy  
And turned them into songs  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
He sang about the copper miners  
And those who worked the land  
He sang about the factory workers  
And they knew he was their man  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
He campaigned for Allende  
Working night and day  
He sang "Take hold of your brothers hand  
You know the future begins today"  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
Then the generals seized Chile  
They arrested Victor then  
They caged him in a stadium  
With five-thousand frightened men  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
Victor stood in the stadium  
His voice was brave and strong  
And he sang for his fellow prisoners  
Till the guards cut short his song  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
They broke the bones in both his hands  
They beat him on the head  
They tore him with electric shocks  
And then they shot him dead  
His hands were gentle, his hands were strong  
Repeat first verse  
  


[CHORUS:]  
Rolling, wheeling like I'm feeling  
Everything's gonna carry on  
You go your way, I'm going my way  
We will come and so be gone  
  
Wheel of fortune, turn for me now  
Turn to trouble in the West  
Wheels of completion rolling  
Wait to put my mind to rest  
  
[CHORUS:]  
Hey, Ezekiel, you can leave now  
You got to go or stay so long  
While your wheels just keep turning  
Turn to rhythm right and wrong  
  
[CHORUS:]  
Wheel of fortune, turn for me now  
Turn to trouble in the West  
Wheels of completion rolling  
Wait to put my mind at rest


Halfway around the world tonight  
In a strange and foreign land  
A soldier packs his memories  
As he leaves Afghanistan  
And back home, they don't know too much  
There's just no way to tell  
I guess you had to be there  
For to know that war was hell  
And there won't be any victory parades  
For those that's coming back  
They'll fly them in at midnight  
And unload the body sacks  
And the living will be walking down  
A long and lonely road  
Because nobody seems to care these days  
When a soldier makes it home  
They'll say it wasn't easy  
Just another job, well done  
As the government in Kabul falls  
To the sounds of rebel guns  
And the faces of the comrades  
Being blown out of the sky  
Leaves you bitter with the feeling  
That they didn't have to die  
And there won't be any victory parades  
For those that's coming back  
They'll fly them in at midnight  
And unload the body sacks  
And the living will be walking down  
A long and lonely road  
Because nobody seems to care these days  
When a soldier makes it home  
Halfway around the world tonight  
In a strange and foreign land  
A soldier unpacks memories  
That he saved from Vietnam  
Back home they didn't know too much  
There was just no way to tell  
I guess you had to be there  
For to know that war was hell  
And there wasn't any big parades  
For those that made it back  
They flew them in at midnight  
And unloaded all the sacks  
And the living were left walking down  
A long and lonely road  
Because nobody seemed to care back then  
When a soldier made it home  
The night is coming quickly  
And the stars are on their way  
As I stare into the evening  
Looking for the words to say  
That I saw the lonely soldier  
Just a boy that's far from home  
And I saw that I was just like him  
While upon this earth I roam  
And there may not be any big parades  
If I ever make it back  
As I come home under cover  
Through a world that can't keep track  
Of the heroes who have fallen  
Let alone the ones who won't  
Which is why nobody seems to care  
When a soldier makes it home  


Words and music by Jimmy Rodgers  
Cattle prowl and the coyotes howl  
Out on the Great Divide  
Never done no wrong, just singin' a song  
As down the trail I ride  
Rattle snakes rattle at the prairie dogs  
You can hear that mournful tune  
'Cause it's round-up time, a-way out west  
When the cactus is in bloom  
Yodel...  
CHORUS  
Daylight comes and the cowhands yell  
They call out every man  
Throw my saddle on my old cow horse  
I drink my coffee from a can  
The sun goes down on the cattle trail  
And I'm gazin' at the moon  
'Cause it's round-up time, a-way out west  
When the cactus is in bloom  
Yodel . . .  
Now we don't have cold weather  
It never snows or rains  
This is where the sun shines best  
Out on the western plains  
Some of the boys are gone away  
But they will be back soon  
'Cause it's round-up time, a-way out west  
When the cactus is in bloom  
Yodel...  
CHORUS  
  


Oh, the time will come up when the winds will stop  
And the breeze will cease to be breathin'  
Like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins  
The hour that the ship comes in  
And the sea will split and the ships will hit  
And the sands on the shoreline will be shakin?  
And the tide will pound and the wind will sound  
And the mornin? will be a breakin?  
The fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path  
And the seagulls, they'll be a smilin?  
And the rocks on the sand will proudly stand  
The hour that the ship comes in  
And the words that are used for to get the ship confused  
Will not be understood as they're spoken  
For the chains of the sea will have busted in the night  
And be buried on the bottom of the ocean  
A song will lift as the mainsail shifts  
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline  
And the sun will respect every face on the deck  
The hour that the ship comes in  
And then the sands will roll out a carpet of gold  
For your weary toes to be a touchin'  
And the ship's wise men will remind you once again  
That the whole wide world is watchin'  
Oh, the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes  
And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'  
But they'll pinch themselves and squeal and they'll know that it's for real  
The hour that the ship comes in  
Then they'll raise their hands sayin', we'll meet all your demands  
But we'll shout from the bow, your days are numbered  
And like Pharaoh's tribe they'll be drowned there in the tide  
And like Goliath they'll be conquered  


Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
The sun is sinking down  
I'm standing 'round my window  
You say you're going away  
But I believe in love  
CHORUS:  
The power of love divine  
Will surely shine you'll see  
And guide us to where we ought to be  
You and me  
The moon is coming up  
And I'm still here in prayer  
You say you've had enough  
And that you just don't care  
CHORUS  
But while the stars are coming out  
And light shines from above  
You tell me in my dreams  
That you believe in love  
CHORUS  
The sun is coming up  
A rainbow on my window  
You say you're going away  
And even though you do  
The power of love divine  
Will surely shine you'll see  
And guide you home again to be...  
You and me  
  
  


Baby I wanna tell you all my hopes and dreams and fears  
But I'm watching television, could you get me another beer  
There's wrestling and pro football on, I hope you understand  
I must watch it all for I am a man  
And a man has needs  
And a man has desires  
Eternal fires that burn, burn, burn  
And a man he bleeds  
And a man he perspires  
'Til the stains show on his shirt  
I missed our anniverary and the birth of our son  
It was beyond my control, my team was on a playoff run  
Oh baby, baby, baby, you mean everything to me  
But could you move your butt, you're blocking the TV?  
And a man has needs  
And a man has desires  
Eternal fires that burn, burn, burn  
And a man he bleeds  
And a man he does tire  
Gets sleepy and naps on the couch  
Oh baby, oh honey, oh darling, oh pudding, what are you doing with that
suitcase? Leaving me? What do you mean we don't communicate? We're talking all
the time. We're talk about-- Ooh! Monster trucks! That little Volkswagon ain't
got no chance against The Cowcrusher! c'mon Cowcrusher, crush that little
Volks-- you're gone. I hope she left me one of them pudding pops. They're
tasty.  
And a man has needs  
And a man has desires  
Eternal fires that burn, burn, burn  
And a man he bleeds  
And he shops at Canadian Tire  
And he always keeps his coupons  
And a man has needs  
And a man has desires  
Eternal fires that burn, burn, burn  
And a man he bleeds  
And a man he expires  
And he cried when Wayne Gretzky retired  
  


I used to talk about politics, politics, politics,  
I used to talk about politics but I don't anymore.  
I used to talk about communism, socialism, capitalism  
I used to talk about all those isms but now I'm a dad  
And all I talk about is baby poo  
  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
  
I used to rant about traffic problems,  
Fender benders, stupid signs  
I used to fear an accident  
But now I stay at home  
And talk about:  
  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
  
Sometimes it's all brown and gooey  
Sometimes it looks like dijon mustard  
Sometimes it's like melted crayon  
Sometimes it just smells like POO  
  
I used to talk about philosophy,  
Kafka, Descartes, Socrates  
I used to think metaphysically  
But now I think the world evolves around:  
  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
  
Sometimes it feels just like stucco  
Sometimes it feels like Jell-o pudding  
Sometimes it's like avocado  
Sometimes she just pees on me  
  
I used to be real int'resting  
Discussing issues of the day  
But now I call up my MP  
And tell her all about my baby poo  
  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo  
Baby poo, baby poo  
All I talk about is baby poo

He's got a big gut and a big fat ass  
He's a big fat road manager

I'm a shark, I'm a shark,  
A killer of the ocean,  
I'm a shark, I'm a shark,  
And silently I strike.  
I'm a shark, I'm a shark,  
I'm dumber than a tree,  
I only have three thoughts and they are: eat, swim, ... Eat.  
  
(He's a shark, he's a shark,)  
I was swimming in the ocean,  
(He's a shark, he's a shark,)  
I got picked up by a boat.  
A team of lonely fishermen sold me to a park,  
And now my name is Billy, I'm a Theme Park Shark.  
  
Billy, the themepark shark,  
Performing tricks for tourists that have payed five bucks a head.  
Billy, the themepark shark,  
He looks just like a killer, but he's too well-fed.  
  
The sight of blood once put me in a frenzy,  
Now it means that it's time to clean the pool...  
  
I'm a shark, I'm a shark,  
I'm swimming in a pool,  
I'm a shark, I'm a shark,  
I don't have to fight for food,  
I get three meals a day, and some extra on the weekend  
And I'm the only shark I know who has a dental plan.  
Who has a dental plan.  
  
(He's a shark, he's a shark,)  
And I'm a big attraction.  
(He's a shark, he's a shark,)  
They love to watch me jump,  
I've been the star for years and I've never been for sale,  
At least until the owners think they need a killer whale.  
  
Billy, the themepark shark,  
Jumping out football nets suspended overhead,  
Billy, the themepark shark,  
He looks just like a killer, but he's too well-fed.  
  
I'm a shark, I'm a shark,  
But I'm not in my natural habitat,  
He's fat and old and lazy,  
But I'm happy you're here.  
I really hope these activists don't free Billy,  
'cause out there in the wild, I'd be dead.  
  
The sight of bloodworms put him in a feeding frenzy,  
Now it means that it's time to clean the pool.  
  
Billy, the themepark shark  
Performing tricks for tourists that have payed five bucks a head,  
Billy, the themepark shark,  
  
He looks just like a killer, in the wild, he'd be dead.  
  
Oh, Billy, (Billy) Billy, (Billy)  
The number one attraction of an aqua petting zoo.  
Billy, (Billy) Billy, (Billy)  
The poster fish of tourism Iowa!


There are many wonders in the usa  
The cities and the people, and Disney World, hooray!  
But coming back to Canada with joy the heart does ooze  
'Cause when you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze.  
You buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
When you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze.  
You buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
When you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze.  
I was traveling with a gentleman who didn't like to drink  
When we got to the border, I commenced to think  
I said, "Do me a favour" and he did not refuse  
When we got to the border, he bought me a bottle of booze.  
You buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
When you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze.  
You buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
When you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze.  
You may be in a comedy act, touring through the 'States  
You're playing hard in country bars, things aren't going great  
A fight breaks out at the pool table, you run before you bruise  
But you call the tour successful and buy a bottle of booze.  
You buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
When you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze.  
You buy a bottle of booze  
You buy a bottle of booze  
When you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze.  
Ok, the sad verse now, the sad verse:  
A friend of mine came to me, his face awash in tears  
For he could afford the spirit that gave him cheers (aww)  
I said, "Aw! Stop yer cryin'! I'll wash away those blues...  
When I was at the border, I bought ya a bottle of booze! "  
You buy a bottle of booze (hey!)  
You buy a bottle of booze (hey!)  
When you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze.  
You buy a bottle of booze (hey!)  
You buy a bottle of booze (hey!)  
When you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze.  
You buy a bottle of booze (hey!)  
You buy a bottle of booze (hey!)  
When you get to the border, you buy a bottle of booze.  
Hey!


You know something girl? I'm thinking about you right now.  
You don't want to know what I'm thinking, girl.  
Or... or do you?  
Girl, you think I'm the bomb,  
But I'm old enough to be dating your mom. And I did.  
She wasn't that bad, but you're grounded if you tell your dad  
That you like the way we dance, with rock-hard abs and plastic pants.  
You give us teddy bears,  
And in return we shave our chest hairs. Yeah, we're so manly.  
'Cause we're singing in a boy band.  
The words are stupid, and the music's bland.  
Never see a dime for selling out to the man.  
Yeah, we're a boy band.  
We say we met in church, but we're a product to market research.  
We sing about sex, to little girls who shouldn't think about sex yet.  
It's not like they listen, it's not like they care.  
'Cause when we sweat our bodies glisten.  
We like the color blue. (blue, blue)  
And we're appearing at a mall near you, right beside the food court.  
'Cause we're singing in a boy band.  
The words are stupid, and the music's bland.  
No one likes us here, but we're big in Japan.  
Yeah, we're a boy band.  
Throw your hands up in the air,  
And wave them around like you just don't care.  
You just don't care, you just don't care,  
Now bring your hands down from the air.  
Doo doo doot doot doot, doo doo doot doot doot  
Doo doo doot doot doot, doo doo doot doot doot  
Doo doo doot doot doot, doo doo doot doot doot  
Doo doo doot doot doot, doo doo doot doot doot  
Doo doo doot ahh ahh ahh ahh.  
'Cause we're singing in a boy band.  
The words are stupid and the music's bland.  
Another pollutant in the pop wasteland.  
Yeah, we're a boy band.  
Yeah, we're a boy band.  
Yeah, we're a boy band.  
  


Listen up brothers and sisters come hear my desperate tale  
I speak of our friends of nature trapped in the dirt like a jail  
Vegetables live in oppression, served on our tables each night  
This killing of veggies is madness, I say we take up the fight  
Salads are only for murderers, coleslaw's a fascist regime  
Don't think that they don't have feelings, just cause a radish can't scream  
  
[Chorus]  
I've heard the screams of the vegetables (scream, scream, scream)  
Watching their skins being peeled (having their insides revealed)  
Grated and steamed with no mercy (burning off calories)  
How do you think that feels (bet it hurts really bad)  
Carrot juice constitutes murder (and that's a real crime)  
Greenhouses prisons for slaves (let my vegetables go)  
It's time to stop all this gardening (it's dirty as hell)  
Let's call a spade a spade (is a spade is a spade is a spade)  
  
I saw a man eating celery, so I beat him black and blue  
If he ever touches a sprout again, I'll bite him clean in two  
I'm a political prisoner, trapped in a windowless cage  
Cause I stopped the slaughter of turnips by killing five men in a rage  
I told the judge when he sentenced me, "This is my finest hour,  
I'd kill those farmers again just to save one more cauliflower"  
  
[Chorus]  
How low as people do we dare to stoop,  
Making young broccolis bleed in the soup?  
Untie your beans, uncage your tomatoes  
Let potted plants free, don't mash that potato!  
Oh spare the spud! Eat a cow instead!  
  
I've heard the screams of the vegetables (scream, scream, scream)  
Watching their skins being peeled (fates in the stir-fry are sealed)  
Grated and steamed with no mercy (you fat gourmet slob)  
How do you think that feels? (leave them out in the field)  
Carrot juice constitutes murder (V8's genocide)  
Greenhouses prisons for slaves (yes, your composts are graves)  
It's time to stop all this gardening (take up macrame)  
Let's call a spade a spade  
(is a spade, is a spade, is a spade, is a spade......)  
  
Power to the peas! Give peas a chance!  
all we are saying, is give peas a chance


I think I've got a crush on Celine Dion  
The way she beats her chest when she sings a love song  
There's something about her makes me want to feed her  
And I'd love to be Mister Celine Dion  
She'll sing a song in English, and she'll sing en francais  
Both the songs will suck, but I love her anyway  
She's full of emotion, I'm full of devotion  
For Celine and I'll be hers someday  
Oh Celine Dion, you soft-rock my world  
Won't you please be mine Celine  
I would do anything, if you'd be my girl  
Oh, be my girl Celine  
I sent you cards and letters, but you don't respond  
You play hard to get, but my heart goes on and on (and on and on, etc...)  
I just wanna say, je aimerez  
And I can see your house from my van  
Oh Celine Dion, you soft-rock my world  
Won't you please be mine Celine  
I would do anything, if you'd be my girl  
Oh, be my girl Celine  
Celine Celine  
Her skin's so soft and clean  
Just like porcelain  
I wish she'd slather me  
With a tub of Vaseline  
(That was a little creepy) I'm sorry, Celine  
Celine Celine  
Celine Dion  
  


Christmas is here, where did the time go?  
Got to load up the reindeer, put on my red suit and go  
I use to like Christmas, but every year it gets worse  
Getting gift to six billion people is just too much damn work  
Got the Christmas blues, man this job is killing me  
And most of these stupid new houses don't even have chimneys  
I use to be jolly, now I'm depressed  
Had a twinkle in my eye, now I've got a bullet proof vest  
'cause if the pace don't kill me, some gun totting yahoo will  
They keep shooting at me like I'm some sort of big fat red criminal  
Got the Christmas blues, I'm starting to see  
That I gotta be some sort of loser to get paid in milk and cookies  
I've grown to hate kids, especially their mail  
Always asking me for stuff, well guess what I don't care, oh  
Maybe I'm getting cranky as I get old  
'cause I feel like giving them all a big lump of coal  
Got the Christmas blues, man, enough is enough  
Next year you can find some other sucker to deliver this stuff  
Got the Christmas blues, I tell you I'm gonna quit  
And find me a steady job with good benefits


The holidays are over, you've gained twenty pounds  
The cat's choking on tinsel, pine needles stalk the ground  
There are no cards in the mailbox, just a stack of bills  
Yes, the holidays are over and you are feeling ill  
Have a happy Christmas hangover  
It's the most miserable time of the year  
The eggnog's made you fat, the party is over  
'Cept for your wacky Uncle who is still drinking your beer  
Turkey's great on Christmas bur after a whole month  
Of turkey pie stew and pie you start to dread lunch  
Breakfast is much scarier 'cause all there is to eat  
Is fourteen Christmas cakes and a bag of cranberries  
Have a happy Christmas hangover  
It's the most miserable time of the year  
Your uncle's in the bathroom and granny's on the sofa  
And you start to wish that they'd just disappear  
You ate too many liquor-filled chocolates  
Got no money left in your pockets  
But at least you got lots of  
Ugly sweaters and bow ties and socks  
(And twenty-two calenders!)  
You're skin is pale and pasty, your energy is spent  
Along with all the money you need to pay the rent  
The children are all crying 'cause they've broken all their toys  
Is this misery worth one day of joy?  
Have a happy Christmas hangover  
It's the most miserable time of the year  
Your uncle has passed out on granny on the sofa  
And you start to wish that you could disappear  
And you start to wish that you cold disappear  


It's Christmas in Ignace  
Mommy's got a rock  
She'll give it to Daddy  
It's Christmas in Ignace (It's Christmas in Ignace)  
It's Christmas in Ignace  
Daddy's got a rock  
He'll give it to Mommy  
It's Christmas in Ignace (It's Christmas in Ignace)  
It's a jolly time (here in Ignace)  
As we decorate the Christmas Rock  
It's a happy time  
And if the children are good they'll get toys to play with  
Like rocks  
It's Christmas in Ignace  
Bob's got a rock  
But he's gonna keep it  
It's Christmas in Ignace (It's Christmas in Ignace)  
It's Christmas in Ignace  
Jill's got a rock  
She gives it to Bob  
Now he's got two  
It's Christmas in Ignace (It's Christmas in Ignace)  
It's a jolly time  
As we sit and watch Rocky 1,2,3,4,5  
It's a happy time  
Except for Malcolm  
His tongue is stuck to the sign that says,  
"Welcome to Ignace"  
It's Christmas in Ignace  
And all through the houses  
Not a creature is stirring  
Except for the rats  
That live here in Ignace  
Under the rocks  
That are played with by children  
And thrown at Malcolm  
Who's still stuck to the sign that says  
"Welcome to Ignace"  
It's Christmas in Ignace (It's Christmas in Ignace)  


One year I got a dog for Christmas  
And I gave it to the boy next door  
Then I gave him my bike and my mom's bank card  
'cause that's what Christmas is for  
I used to give a lot at Christmas  
You might say I gave to much  
Until my family was broke and we had no place to live  
That's why, Christmas Sucks  
I went down to the mall each Christmas  
Had to the Santa what to bring  
A train, a bike, a pony and a great big pile of cash  
And please don't get my sister anything  
But the shopping mall Santa has been drinking  
His nose is red from years of drinking scotch  
He probably won't remember what's on my Christmas list  
This Father Christmas sucks  
Chorus:  
Christmas Sucks, Christmas Sucks  
Getting stuff is much for fun, you gotta look out for number one  
Christmas Sucks  
Christmas became worse as years went by  
It was the most dreaded time of year  
My parents got me clothes that just weren't cool  
When all I want is money to buy beer  
There was a girl at church who I was sweet on  
So in the Christmas play I was the ox  
I really think she liked me til I stepped on Baby Jesus  
Even for our savious Christmas Sucks  
Chorus  
Now that I am thirty-wight years old  
The only things I get are ties and socks  
My kids are never happy with what's under the tree  
Soon they'll understand Christmas Sucks  
Every freakin' year Christmas Sucks  
Christmas Sucks, Christmas Sucks, Christmas Sucks  


Hey kid, why the long face  
Is it 'cause Santa Clause is flying right over your place  
You've been a bad kid all year  
So quit you snivellin' sucker and wipe up them tears  
You don't deserve a damn thing  
You're not even cute and your attitude stinks  
It must suck to be you  
Nobody likes you so what can you do  
You think you got problems kid, you think you got strife  
But come each December do you fear for your life  
I'm your turkey so your troubles are small  
I'm stuffed on your table, I'm a tasty butterball  
I've got the christmas turkey blues  
If you got your necked ripped out then you'd have them too  
I've got the christmas turkey blues  
You chase me and waste and baste me and taste me and drown me in gravy too  
You sir, you look like heck  
Didn't you get your Christmas bonus cheque  
Or maybe your woman left you  
Ripped your heart right out of your chest and spat on it too  
Is that why you're wreaking of gin  
You look dishevelled and there's drool on your chin  
You thought that this love would laugh  
But she said Merry Christmas baby and she booted your ass  
Well that's tough for you mister, too bad about your ordeal  
How about getting stuffed in the wintertime, see how you feel  
I don't get to yank no bones or make me a wish  
It won't be long til I'm just some scraps on a dish  
I've got the christmas turkey blues  
If your butt was stuffed and roasted then you'd have then too  
I've got the christmas turkey blues  
You chase me and waste and baste me and taste me and drown me in gravy too  


I once had a dog named Bob  
And Bob's a funny name for a dog  
If you're gonna get a dog, don't name him Bob  
My neighbour's name is also Bob  
And every time I call my dog  
My neighbour Bob shows up without my dog  
  
Hey, Bob, not you, Bob  
I'm looking for my dog  
Have you seen my dog named Bob?  
My dog named Bob  
  
Bob the dog drank antifreeze  
I got a new dog named Jeez  
So I could yell "Oh Jeez!" just when I please  
And when Jehovah's Witnesses  
  
Come to my house in Saturdays  
I ask them if they'd like to witness Jeez  
Holy Jeez, they fell on their knees  
They beg me, "Please, can we meet Jeez, pretty please?"  
Oh Holy Jeez  
  
Well those Jehovah's Witnesses  
Called the Humane Society  
They took my Jeez away from me  
And then the Catholic diosces  
Made a big deal out of Jeez  
And now I have to pay to go see Jeez  
  
Hey, Jeez, remember me?  
Remember the beach and playing Frisbee with me?  
For the love of Jeez


George Washington was the president  
But now he's dead (dead)  
Mackenzie King was Prime Minister  
But now he's dead (dead)  
  
So don't go into politics  
You'll end up dead  
Don't go into politics  
You'll end up dead  
  
Oppenheimer built the bomb  
But now he's dead (dead)  
Einstien was very very smart  
But not enough not to be dead (dead)  
  
So don't go into science  
You'll end up dead  
Don't go into science  
You'll end up dead  
And don't go into politics  
You'll end up dead  
Don't go into politics  
You'll end up dead  
  
Jimi Hendrix, Janice Joplin, Brian Jones, Keith Moon,  
Jim Morrison, Roy Orbison,  
John Lennon, Bob Marley, Leonard Bernstien, Elvis Presley  
Well, we're not too sure about Elvis  
But I think you get the point  
  
Don't go into music  
You'll end up dead  
Don't go into music  
You'll end up dead  
And don't go into science  
You'll end up dead  
Don't go into politics  
You'll end up dead  
  
Break it down  
You'll be burned, you'll be fried  
You'll be buried alive  
And there's no hope thinkin'  
That you're gonna survive  
'Cause there's the drowning and choking  
And cancer from smoking  
And smothered while sleeping  
And blood will start seeping  
  
So I have found, you'll end up in the ground  
And you'll be dead  
So I have found, you'll end up in the ground  
I wish there was an option instead  
But you'll be dead  
Dead  
Maybe with a bullet in your head  
But you'll be dead  
Dead  
Very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very dead


Drink with me! Drink with me! Drink with me! Drink with me...  
I'm startin' to see double, and I just fell of my stool!  
I'm sluring all my words and I'm covered in my own drool!  
I threw up on my girlfriend and we got into a fight.  
Man oh man, what a fargin' great night!  
Well, I wake up the next morning and my brain is full of pain!  
And I swear to god, I will never drink again.  
But, six o'clock rolls around, and there's nothing on T. V.,  
So I call up all my buddies, and they come drink with me! Oh  
Drink with me... Have a drink to you're health  
Then go and throw up on yourself!  
Drink with me! Drink with me! Drink with me! Ar!  
Well, after six or seven pints I figured I was hosed,  
So I had another five until the bar was closed.  
I staggered back to my place and I cracked another crate!  
When I woke up at sunset I was wearing what I ate.  
I threw up in the bathroom it's amazing what I saw!  
Peas and corn and bicycle parts and meat that still looked raw!  
I stumbled to the kitchen and I had myself a beer!  
Alchohol, alchohol you are a friend so dear! So!  
Drink with me...  
Drink for England drink for France! Drink until you pee your Pants!  
Drink with me! Drink with me! Drink with me! Ar!  
Woke up at six P. M. I needed liquor and a friend!  
So I grabbed a couple bottles and a pig out of it's pen.  
Drank a bottle of tequila, playing stupid drinking games,  
Then, wandered out into the snow and tried to pee our names.  
We staggered to a bar and we ordered up a pint!  
The waiter said he couldn't, he said "We don't serve swine! '  
The pig, he punched the waiter, grabbed the drinks and oinked at him.  
That's no way to talk to my new best friend!  
Drink with me...  
Ninetynine bottles of beer on the wall! Me and the pig'll drink them all!  
Drink with me! Drink with me! Drink with me! Ar!


Well me an' my buddies we got us some beer  
And a great big bottle of rye  
And boxes of ammo and guns to go with 'em  
And good old Charlie's glass eye  
Well we looked all around so we sees all of nature  
So calm and so serene  
But not for long 'cause we're gonna use guns  
To make furry animals scream  
  
'Cause we're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
We're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
  
Well off we go, our guns are loaded  
And so's are we  
We weaves through the bushes and falls on our faces  
And piss on the nice trees  
And then we spot something moving an' a rustle  
We pump it full of lead  
And smile real wide as we hear it scream  
And thud as it falls down dead  
  
'Cause we're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
We're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
  
Well off we go to see what we killed  
And watch the damn thing bleed  
The first thing we see is a bright orange cap  
And we shot down Ol' Charlie  
But he don't to mind, he smiled all the time  
He died real happy  
But next time he should tell us  
When he's goin' off to take a pee  
  
'Cause we're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
We're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
  
Well the sun goes down and we head back to town  
And we hop in our pickup truck  
Strap Charlie to the hood, start up the engine  
Drive it home with any luck  
Well what do you know, we run into a pole  
But we're all still in one piece  
And we get a free ride back into town  
Courtesy of the police.  
  
'Cause we're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!  
We're goin' huntin'  
We're gonna kill somethin'  
I don't care what it is  
Maybe a raccoon, maybe a gopher,  
Maybe the neighbour's kids!


It's great to be a nerd, It's great to be a nerd  
The only light we ever see is from our moniter  
We argue about comic books and Internet connections  
The biggest highlight of the year is the Star Trek Convention  
Our town's not big enough to sign up any stars  
But we once met a red shirt who was phasered by a Borg  
(Man, he knew Mr. Sulu!) (What?)  
It's great to be a nerd, It's great to be a nerd  
We wear our Star Trek uniforms and talk like Captain Kirk  
We have our own heroes who we try to emulate  
I dream of one day being as sexy as Bill Gates  
We hate watching sports 'cause we're reading Carl Sagan  
But we'd watch the Olympics if they played Dungeons and Dragons  
(I'm a Hobbitt! Ha ha ha ha!)  
It's great to be a nerd, It's great to be a nerd  
We think Tolkein was a genius and Shakespeare was a turd  
We rarely get a date or get talked to by a girl  
Unless they're having trouble with their algebra homework  
We're emotionally bereft and we're sexually frustrated  
But we can download photographs of Agent Scully naked  
It's great to be a nerd, It's great to be a nerd  
We know the truth is out there but we'd have to leave our room  
We are the nerds in your neighbourhood  
Polyester's a fashion statement  
But there's more room on the beach for you  
'Cause we're locked in our basement  
It's great to be a nerd, It's great to be a nerd  
We like to wear colours that do not appear in nature  
It's great to be a  
Poorly-dressed fashionless  
Star trekking roleplaying  
Ninety pound when wet down  
Pasty skinned pop drinking  
Underfed genius  
Yes, it's great to be a nerd  
  


I love you so much I need the Heimlich Maneuver  
  
The sun goes down on another day  
A day where I haven't found love  
I try to eat, but all I taste  
Is the flavor of a broken heart  
Then I saw you across the room  
I gasp and my breathing stops  
My heart's in my throat, or is it a potato?  
  
I love you so much, I need the Hiemlich manuver  
Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat  
She's in my thoughts and it'll need a jolt to remove her  
My love is consumating, while I'm asphyxiating  
Over her  
  
When I wake up, I'm on the floor  
Faint, dizzy and alone  
My stomach hurts, I think my ribs are cracked  
Not sure if I'm in a dream  
I turn my head, and there you are  
I call out and my breathing stops  
It's her again, crushing my esophagus  
  
I love you so much, I need the Hiemlich manuver  
Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat  
She's in my thoughts and it'll need a jolt to remove her  
Before my expiration, I need resuscitation  
Mouth to mouth  
  
She throws water on my face, slaps my cheek  
Helps me back on my stool  
She's a waitress here, but in the night  
She's a student at nursing school  
She comes again with a smile and the bill  
I pick it up and choke again  
She's charged me for my lunch and for the medical procedure  
  
I love you so much, I need the Hiemlich manuver  
Your love sticks like a turkey bone in my throat  
She's in my thoughts and it'll need a jolt to remove her  
For my lasting endurance, I'll need medical insurance  
For my bill  
For me to get some peace, I'll need a tracheotomy  
And an airbag


Scott became famous for freezing to death in Antartica.  
Columbus made history thinking some island was India.  
General Custer's a national hero for not knowing when to run.  
All these men are famous, and they're also very dumb.  
  
History is made by stupid people.  
Clever people wouldn't even try.  
If you wanna place in the history books,  
Then do something dumb before you die.  
  
Nobility are famous for no reason.  
Marie Antoinette enjoyed her cake.  
She cause a Revolution when she would not share.  
And her husband lost his head for that mistake.  
  
The Hindenberg was a giant zeppelin.  
Her makers made a minor oversight.  
Before they filled it up with explosive gas  
They should have fixed the no smoking light.  
  
'Cause!  
History is made by stupid people.  
Clever people wouldn't even try.  
If you wanna place in the history books,  
Then do something dumb before you die.  
  
Tally-Ho! Tally-Ho!  
Our king and country's honor we will save.  
Tally-Ho! Tally-Ho!  
We're marching into history and the grave.  
  
So, if your son or daughter seem too lazy,  
Sitting there watching mad T. V.  
Just remember you should be quite grateful  
At least they're not making history.  
  
Ahhh!  
History is made by stupid people.  
Clever people wouldn't even try.  
If you wanna place in the history books,  
Then do something dumb before you die.  
Do something dumb before you die  
Do something dumb before you die!!


I am cow hear me moo  
I weigh twice as much as you  
And I look good on the barbecue  
Yogurt, curd, cream cheese, and butter's  
made from liquid from my udders  
I am cow, I am cow, hear me moo!  
  
I am cow, eating grass  
methane gas comes out my ass  
and out my muzzle when I belch  
o the ozone layer is thinner  
from the outcome of my dinner  
I am cow, I am cow, I've got gas  
  
I am cow, here I stand  
far and wide upon this land  
and I am living everywhere  
from B.C. to Newfoundland  
You can squeeze my teats by hand  
I am cow, I am cow, I am cow  
I am cow, I am cow, I am cow!


I pulled my groin  
It's the very best injury  
Though I'm walking daintily  
I pulled my groin  
I pulled my groin  
When people ask, "It hurts you where?"  
I say "Put your hand right there"  
I pulled my groin  
I pulled my groin  
I pulled my groin  
Though I do not enjoy walking  
I am really happy talking  
'bout my groin  
I pulled my groin  
I pulled my groin  
It's the treatment that I love  
Because I've bought some oil to rub  
I pulled my groin  
I pulled my groin  
Unless we're in playoff time  
When I've got a lower body injury that  
Will have to be a game time decision  
I pulled my groin  
It hurts me when I skate  
But not when I master.. Hills  
I pulled my groin  
I pulled my groin


If you haven't heard of me  
I wouldn't be surprised  
I bet you know my relatives  
Their names will never die  
My mother is a saint  
And my brother is a god  
But all I am is Jesus' brother Bob  
  
Jesus' brother Bob, Jesus' brother Bob  
A nobody relative of the son of God  
If only I'd been born just a little sooner  
I'd be more than the brother of God Junior  
  
I have to pay the ferry  
To cross the Galilee  
But not my brother  
No not him  
He walks across for free  
I finally get to work  
'Bout a quarter after nine  
Already he's turning water into wine  
  
Jesus' brother Bob, Jesus' brother Bob  
A nobody relative of the son of God  
If only I'd been born just a little sooner  
I'd be more than the brother of God Junior  
  
One day when I was home  
I heard a mighty r oar  
There were a thousand people  
Right outside the door  
Help us, Jesus, help us!  
Came the cheering from the mob  
But then they got a look at me  
Oh nuts, it's only Bob  
  
Jesus' brother Bob, Jesus' brother Bob  
A nobody relative of the son of God  
If only I'd been born just a little sooner  
I'd be more than the brother of God Junior  
  
He died upon the cross  
I thought that I was free  
Finally people would get to know  
Me for me  
(Hi Bob, Hi Judas!)  
This was my big chance  
To finally get ahead  
The next thing you know  
He's rising from the dead  
  
Jesus' brother Bob, Jesus' brother Bob  
A nobody relative of the son of God  
If only I'd been born just a little sooner  
I'd be more than the brother of God Junior  
  
Everybody!  
  
Jesus' brother Bob, Jesus' brother Bob  
A nobody relative of the son of God  
If only I'd been born just a little sooner  
I'd be more than the brother of God Junior  
  
ahhhahhhhahhh-Bob


I once was a happy man of sound and stable mind  
Then my neighbour bought a dog  
He put a ribbon on it's head to make it cute  
But it still looked like a chihuahua  
He had me over to watch it sit and beg  
It bit my knee, and made love to my leg  
Now it barks all the night and all of the day  
Whenever it's not peeing on my lawn  
I didn't get to sleep last night till very late  
The stupid dog barked and grrrr'd  
I got up late for work and ran to catch the bus  
But I slipped on a turd  
I was certain it wasn't one of mine  
That that dog had crossed over the line  
I wanted to exterminate it and all it's kind  
From my lovely little suburb  
I'm gonna kill the dog next door  
Ain't gonna bark anymore  
'Cause this is Judgment Day  
And the little runt has got to pay  
No more turds on my lawn  
That stupid mutt will soon be gone  
Gonna kill kill kill kill kill kill kill that dog  
I see the little monster in my garden  
So I grab an axe and off I go  
And I try my best to get it  
All I do is sever my big toe  
My neighbour comes outside to call me  
He says his dog and me should just be friends  
He puts his little pet in my forgiving hands  
Then it starts to bite  
So I strangle it with all my might  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!  
I'm gonna kill the dog next door (kill the dog next door)  
Ain't gonna bark anymore  
'Cause this is Judgment Day  
And the little runt has got to pay  
No more turds on my lawn (doo-doos on my lawn)  
That stupid mutt will soon be gone  
Gonna kill kill kill kill kill kill kill that dog  
Now the stupid mutt's in doggy heaven  
I strangled it to death and now I'm free  
But my trouble ain't quite over  
My neighbour called the cops on me  
I end up at the police station  
Where I am told that I must pay  
A 300 dollar fine  
Wow, what a good value  
I think I'll kill my neighbour too!  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!  
I'm gonna kill the guy next door (kill the guy next door)  
Won't call the cops anymore  
I never liked him anyway  
300 isn't much to pay  
There are turds on my lawn (doo-doos on my lawn)  
They must be his, his dog is gone  
Gonna kill kill kill kill kill kill kill  
Kill kill kill kill kill kill kill  
Kill kill kill kill kill kill kill that guy!

Billy solves his problems by calling up his mom  
Heather solves her problems with drugs and Alcohol  
Daniel solves his problems with a doctor and the law  
But Malcolm has his own way and it's better than them all  
CHORUS  
'Cause Malcolm solves his problems with a chainsaw  
And he never has the same problem twice  
Whether it's a bill or a cheque arriving late  
Rancid marble cheese or a steak that's second rate  
Awful TV programs or a broken ELvis plate  
Or his fiancee who dumps him because he's gaining weight  
CHORUS  
Aaaaggghhh Aaaaggghhh  
Problem solved  


Me work hard 5 days a week  
Sweeping garbage from the street  
Come home not want book to read  
Not 'nuff pictures for me see  
Sit right down in favourite chair  
Wearing only underwear  
Favourite night is Saturday night  
'Cause me can watch hockey fights  
Me Like Hockey!  
Me not like pro basketball  
'Cause me short and they all tall  
Baseball slow like Forrest Gump  
'Cept when Robby spits on ump  
Wrestlemania not so great  
Me like to see Hulk Hogan skate  
TV soccer not so hot  
You play bad then you get shot  
Me Like Hockey!  
Swedish players must be geeks  
'Cause they still got own real teeth  
Not like Finnish players names  
What's a Teemu anyways?  
Russians worse in history  
Got stupid names like Valery  
Me like Sergei Federov  
Me like him more if head were off  
ha! ha! ha!  
Me Like Hockey!  
Please Mr. Linseman let the players  
fight  
Friends come over put game on  
Argue then we lat bets down  
Got bag of chips and case of Bud  
Should last till end of first period  
But Yankees they win the World Cup  
Me think the cheat use glowy puck!  
Maybe if we want to win her  
Maybe we should play in winter  
Me Like Hockey!


On the Mounted Animal Nature Trail, you'll be sure to see  
All Mother Nature's favourite pets, all sitting rigidly  
They're never hungry any more, their last meal left them stuffed  
Don't worry, they won't walk away if you try and pet their fluff  
  
And the dog goes...  
And the cow goes...  
And the bear goes...  
And the pig goes...  
And the crow goes caw!, I guess it was alive  
You can see all this  
On the Mounted Animal Nature Trail  
  
The Mounted Animal Nature Trail, it's great for Mom and Dad  
Where else can Grandma and the kids see the silence of the lambs?  
Don't have to walk a hundred miles ore climb the steepest hill  
And the only fearsome sound you'll hear is the ringing of the till  
  
And the dog goes...  
And the cow goes...  
And the bear goes...  
And the pig goes...  
And the crow goes caw!, I guess it was alive  
You can see all this  
On the Mounted Animal Nature Trail  
  
The only things that bite are the bugs (Oww..)  
And unlike other theme parks, the mice won't say "Hello"  
And if you're having troubles with your own family pet  
You can bring him and add him to the trail  
  
Everyone, and the dog goes...  
And the cow goes...  
And the bear goes...  
And the pig goes...  
And the crow goes caw!, I guess it was alive  
You can see all this  
On the Mounted Animal Nature Trail


Last night when I went to bed  
With tangled hair upon my head  
In every way I really was a kid  
It happened without warning  
When I woke up in the morning  
I can't tell you just what happened but it did  
  
I grew six inches in one day  
It's painful when it goes that way  
And now my skinny body's really achin'  
And my skin just exploded  
With an inch of oil it's loaded  
It's so greasy you could fry a pound of bacon  
  
My voice is changing  
Out of thin air  
And body parts that once were smooth  
Are growing bits of hair  
My voice is changing  
What does it mean?  
I guess I'll be a real man  
Before I turn 13  
  
I buy two pairs of jeans a week  
I'm such a tall and awkward geek  
I fall down when I try to play a grounder  
At dinner every night I eat  
A giant heaping plate of meat  
Then go out with my friends for quarter pounders  
  
And weird emotions come alive  
My hormones are in overdrive  
I've turned into a girl-watching creature  
And all my friends their marks are shot  
But they don't care because they're hot  
For Mrs. Smith the mathematics teacher  
  
My voice is changing  
I hate to hear it crack  
I pray to God I won't inherit  
Dad's hairy back  
My voice is changing  
When will it end?  
And when will mom stop kissing me  
In front of all my friends?  
  
Pretty soon I bet I'll  
Be right into heavy metal  
But my parents say at least it isn't rap  
I'll start wearing stupid clothes  
And threaten that I'll pierce my nose  
And tell my parents all they like is crap  
  
The first girl that I ever kiss  
Will be the one and who could miss  
Our love forever written in the stars?  
But I don't think our love will last  
Unless the four years go by fast  
Till I can use the backseat of the car  
  
My voice is changing  
Out of thin air  
And body parts that once were smooth  
Are growing bits of hair  
My voice is changing  
What does it mean?  
I guess I'll be a real man  
Before I turn 13  
  
My voice is changing  
I hate to hear it crack  
I pray to God I won't inherit  
Dad's hairy back  
My voice is changing  
When will it end?  
And when will mom stop kissing me  
In front of all my friends?  
  
Cha-cha-cha!


Our love is like a new car smell  
Sooner or later it all goes to hell  
Somebody farts or spills some taco bell  
Our love is like a new car smell  
Our love is like a barbeque ignition  
You know that button you push lights the propane emission  
It works for a month then the spark goes missing  
Our love is like a barbeque ignition  
Our love is like a video game  
That you play alot and then it gets lame  
Then a new one comes out that's better but the same  
Our love is like a video game  
Our love..  
Our love is like a surgical procedure  
It's painful and invasive, your insurance won't cover  
And when it's done you walk funny forever  
Our love is like a surgical procedure  
Our love is like a Meatloaf song  
It has its moments but it's way too long  
Like a bat outta hell it all goes wrong  
Our love is like a Meatloaf song  
Our love is like Keanu Reeves  
Who's made some really bad movies  
That's all time you can't retrieve  
Our love is like Keanu Reeves  
Our love..


Open my eyes, what a beautiful day  
Just the type that makes me want to say hooray  
I'm still a little fuzzy-headed from my sleep  
Into my brain reality seeps  
Look all around me, can't believe what I see  
These little short people are surrounding me  
I've got a white beard, a suit made of red  
My soul becomes filled with a keen sense of dread  
  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
  
Hop out of bed, kick an elf in the chest  
What an awful way to awake from a rest  
"Santa, oh, Santa," the little gnomes cheer  
"You shouldn't be nasty at this time of year!"  
"What do you mean?" I say in a rage  
"And what are you doing with those big burlap bags?"  
The elves they do roar, "Why their full of toys  
For you to deliver to the good girls and boys. "  
  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
  
Resigned to my fate, I load up the sleigh  
Harness the reindeer and get under way  
It's nippy up here in the cool arctic sky  
Good thing I remembered that bottle of rye  
Flying over rooftops, throwing out toys  
Hopefully crushing those good girls and boys  
Like a bad dream, I pray for release  
Please let this hellish existence be ceased!  
  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
Oh God, I'm Santa Claus  
  
From this nightmare I finally awake  
My brain is on fire, my hands they do shake  
But wait, they're not hands, they're cute little paws  
I'm the Easter Bunny, I'm not Santa Claus!  
  
Oh God, I'm the Easter Bunny  
Oh God, I 'm Easter Bunny  
Oh God, I'm Easter Bunny  
Oh God, I'm Easter Bunny


Well my baby came at me with a 2x4  
So I fought her off with sandpaper  
It was 60 grit, it was really rough  
And it made a lot of sawdust  
But we patched things up with love and glue  
We went to the church and said "I do"  
Our honeymoon was at a hardware store  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
Particle Board, it ain't got no grain  
Unless you paint it with a darkwood stain  
Particle Board, it doesn't take no brains to know that  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
Well I heard the train come rolling by  
With cattle on board, so we decided  
We should drop everything and hop that train  
And take a one-way trip to the slaughterhouse  
Well we stared at the cattle as they took the walk  
To meet the man who worked the saw  
We stared at the blood and the guts and the gore  
It looked an awful lot like particle board  
Particle Board, it ain't got no grain  
Unless you paint it with a darkwood stain  
Particle Board, it doesn't take no brains to know that  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
We made love on a flat bed truck  
She worried about getting splinters in her butt  
I said don't think about those problems when we rut  
The deck's made of particle board  
Ahh, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  
Particle board, you could make a dresser  
Or a shelf or a hutch or an ottoman  
You could leave it like it is or paint it up  
It's still gonna be made of particle board  
Particle board, it's useful stuff  
It's stronger than glue, it's better than fluff  
It sounds like a simile and that's enough  
To say that our love's a lot like particle board  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
Our love's a lot like particle board  
Ahh, ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh  
Particle Board!


I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
'Cause I get to play with other people's money  
  
I'm having a lousy day  
I burned my toast and spilled my coffee  
On my best shirt. So I had to change and then  
I'm late for work. So I rush into the meeting  
Where they are discussing what my future in the corporation is  
And I don't really give a damn  
But I don't have another job  
And so I lie and say  
  
I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
'Cause I get to talk to stimulating people  
  
I open up my mail  
Hoping that it's not a bill but it's from the bank  
Saying that I have only 20 hours to go  
To contribute to my RRSP for this tax year  
So I run down to the bank but there's a 20-mile lineup  
And I'm yelling and I'm screaming  
And I'm not wearing any pants ah ah ah ah ahhhhh  
  
I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
'Cause I get to screw with other people's lives  
  
I took out 40 bucks  
From the automatic teller. It told me  
That I couldn't 'cause I just had 10  
But that can't be 'cause I just got paid on Friday  
So I go down to the bank, wait an hour in the lineup  
And I'm talking to the teller  
She says "Wait I'll get your last month's statement"  
She comes back in 7 hours  
Says I've got some interest charges and a cheque from Uncle Bill  
That bounced and so they'll have to charge me 40 bucks for that  
And for the box I never opened and I don't have overdraft protection  
And I think I'll die before I pay off all that I owe and I don't even  
Own a car  
  
I'm pleased to be a banker  
I'm proud to be a banker  
I'm pleased to be a banker  
'Cause I get to play with other people's money  
  
(HE'S A BANKER)  
Would you please endorse this cheque?  
(HE'S A BANKER)  
Do you have any assets?  
(HE'S A BANKER)  
You should buy you shouldn't rent  
(HE'S A BANKER)  
The cheque will cost you fifty cents  
(IT WILL COST YOU FIFTY CENTS)  
(He's a banker and he says  
That it will cost you fifty cents  
He's a banker and he says  
That it will cost you fifty cents)  
(IT WILL COST YOU FIFTY CENTS)


Our fair country Canada  
Is north of the USA  
Our maritimes are lovely  
And our prairies give us hay  
You might think you Yankees are better than us Canucks  
But we don't need no microchips inside our hockey pucks  
  
We know that you've got Disney World  
And you keep it very clean  
We don't have Bob Dole  
But we can drink when we're 19  
We even watch your TV shows for hours and hours and hours  
We'll give you Alan Thicke but Shania Twain is ours  
  
We're proud to be Canadian  
We're awfully nice to strangers  
Our manners feel our curse  
It's cool in many ways to be Canadian  
We won't say that we are better  
It's just that we're less worse  
  
Your beer is not too tasty  
And you weather can't be beat  
We all fly south in the winter time  
To escape the snow and sleet  
We're pleased to say we've enjoyed all your southern charms  
But we get sun burnt when we exercise our right to bear our arms  
  
We're proud to be Canadian  
We're awfully nice to strangers  
Our manners feel our curse  
It's cool in many ways to be Canadian  
We won't say that we are better  
It's just that we're less worse  
  
Alanis Morrissette  
She is our latest pride and joy  
She used to sing about high school dances  
And chancing after boys  
But now she is fed up and about as angry as can be  
She's got one hand in her pocket and the other is on guard for thee  
  
We're proud to be Canadian  
We're awfully nice to strangers  
Our manners feel our curse  
It's cool in many ways to be Canadian  
We won't say that we are better  
It's just that we're less worse  
  
We're proud to be Canadian  
We're awfully nice to strangers

We won't say that we are better  
It's just that we're less worse  
  
We won't say that we are better  
It's just that we're less worse  
  
Tears are not enough!


It's the most frightening thing in the world  
It's the scariest sight I've ever seen  
The most chilling visual  
The most terrifying scene  
It's awful, it's crappy, it's monstrous, it's bad  
It's really really huge  
It's a fat man in a Speedo  
I'm walking on a beach in a tropical isle  
Hoping to enjoy the sand and surf  
When I see a mound of baby-oiled flesh  
Rolling and a broiling in the foam  
The only thing that's holding this  
Explosion of Caucasian is  
A tiny red synthetic coloured thread  
I try to sink it in the sand  
And entomb it in a castle but  
It always manages to break free  
The fat man in a Speedo  
I'm having nightmares  
I'm scared to open my eyes  
I try to free myself  
By going to the buffet  
But there he is  
He even eats in his Speedo  
I take up a collection at the bar the next day  
And everybody gives to the cause  
To rent a helicopter that will take this whale  
To Cuba and free the horizon from his bulk  
We have a celebration  
In one of his indentations  
And throw a bowl of jello in the air  
We think we've escaped and our scenery is clear  
But in comes a plane from Germany  
Thirty fat German men wearing Speedos!


Special guest vocalist, Mike's dad: Bob McCormick  
(Mike's dad appears courtesy of Mike's mom)  
There once was a time when the country was wide. A time before cars and planes
and minivans. So, to move things from one place to the other, the railroad was
built. But it just didn't up and build itself. Nope, it was built by the
railroad men. And among these men was a man among men among men among men
among men among men, a man as tall as the sky and as wide as the land. A man
who could lay track faster than anyone else could run. A man with the strength
of ten men. His name was John Henry, and I'm not gonna sing about him. No, I'm
gonna sing about a lesser know figure, one who doesn't deserve a song. A man
as lazy as a thousand men. A man who could barely raise his own body off the
ground. A man who was barely a man at all. His name was Mike McCormick.  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
Who never really gave a damn  
Only thing he worked on was his tan  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
He'd get up in the morning to hammer in them spikes  
Unless he'd been up drinking the previous night  
Or if his bones weren't feeling right  
Or if it looked like it was going to rain  
He had a tendency of being late for work  
And everyone around thought he was a jerk  
He'd take long breaks and say his back was hurt  
Then he'd have a drink to ease the pain  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
Who never really gave a damn  
Only thing he worked on was his tan  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
Mike's dad: Mike! Mike! Get up, Mike!  
Mike: What, what is it?  
Mike's dad: Get up, it's time to go to work.  
Mike: Awww, already?  
Mike's dad: Well, don't you want to hammer in them spikes?  
Mike: No.  
Mike's dad: Oh.  
His arms were like twigs and his legs were like straws  
His hands were like a baby's bum they were so soft  
He'd wheeze and moan and whine and cough  
Then go home and take a little nap  
He never got fired 'cause he was the boss' son  
He just hung around and bothered everyone  
Never drove a spike, not a single one  
Though now and then he'd give a tap  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
Who never really gave a damn  
Only thing he worked on was his tan  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
Mike's dad: Mike! Mike! MIKE!  
Mike: What? What is it?  
Mike's dad: They say they got a big machine that they say can drive in nails
faster than any man alive.  
Mike: Sounds like a good idea.  
Mike's dad: No! No! No!  
Mike: Yeah, it'll work faster.  
Mike's dad: You don't understand! You see, it's gonna cost us all our jobs.
You, Mike McCormick, gotta prove 'em wrong!  
Mike: Okay.  
So he took his hammer and hammered one time (Ow!)  
He took his hammer and hammered two times (Oh, jeez!)  
He took his hammer and hammered three times (Ohhh!)  
Then he got crushed by a meteor and died  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
Who never really gave a damn  
Only thing he worked on was his tan  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man  
Mike McCormick was a steel drivin' man (steel drivin' maaaan)  
  


I'm out on the range, surveying the land  
Thinking of the job that's to be done  
My life is hard but I don't mind  
Men like me, that's how the west was won  
I stand the pain and the suffering  
For on the trail I am the king  
On doors I knock and on bells I ring  
Always sure that I will get the sale  
  
'Cause I am Dan the Insurance Salesman  
In a beat-up Chevrolet I do ride  
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally  
And on the dotted line I make them sign  
Hi-de-hey (Hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey) hey!  
  
The door swings wide and I sense my prey  
Ready to fall victim to my pitch  
I tell him all about the plan  
With all of its inherent benefits  
If you lose an arm it's a thousand bucks  
Lose both of them and get twice as much  
And if you should die, well then, bless your luck  
You'll just be raking in the cash  
  
'Cause I am Dan the Insurance Salesman  
In a beat-up Chevrolet I do ride  
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally  
And on the dotted line I make them sign  
Hi-de-hey (Hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey) hey!  
  
The sucker signs, the deed is done  
It's time for me to get back on the road  
A lonely man out on the land  
Where the wind can blow so cold  
I ride into the setting sun  
With the knowledge of a job well done  
But I can't rest until everyone  
Has become properly insured  
  
'Cause I am Dan the Insurance Salesman  
In a beat-up Chevrolet I do ride  
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally  
And on the dotted line I make them sign  
Hi-de-hey (Hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey, hi-de-hey) hey!  
  
Yes, I am Dan the Insurance Salesman  
In a beat-up Chevrolet I do ride  
I rope them in and tie them up and bind them legally  
For on the dotted line I make them sign

Gonna go out and play some golf

I'm gonna go out and play some golf  
My putter alone was a thousand bucks  
I'm gonna go out and suck at golf  
Think I better take a muligan ya, ya

Everyobody hits it farther than me  
Just 8 more strokes then I reach a par 3

Never be as good as Tiger Woods  
My balls always goin off into the woods  
Never be as good as Tiger Woods

Never be as good as Tiger Woods  
Get up get up get up get up get up

Hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry  
Slow down! Slow down  
Don't hit the tree don't hit the tree  
Hit the tree hit the tree  
I really hate this stupid game


Once a year we celebrate  
With stupid hats and plastic plates  
The fact that you were able to make  
Another trip around the sun  
  
And the whole clan gathers round  
And gifts and laughter do abound  
And we let out a joyful sound  
And sing that stupid song  
  
Happy birthday!  
Now you're one year older!  
Happy birthday!  
Your life still isn't over!  
Happy birthday!  
You did not accomplish much  
But you didn't die this year  
I guess that's good enough  
  
So let's drink to your fading health  
And hope you don't remind yourself  
The chance of finding fame and wealth  
Decrease with every year  
  
Does it feel like you're doing laps  
And eating food and taking naps  
And hoping that someday perhaps  
Your life will hold some cheer  
  
Happy birthday!  
What have you done that matters?  
Happy birthday!  
You're starting to get fatter  
Happy birthday!  
It's downhill from now on  
Try not to remind yourself  
Your best years are all gone  
  
If cryogenics were all free  
Then you could live like Walt Disney  
And live for all eternity  
Inside a block of ice  
  
But instead your time is set  
This is the only life you get  
And though it hasn't ended yet  
Sometimes you wish it might  
  
Happy birthday!  
You wish you had more money  
Happy birthday!  
Your life's so sad it's funny  
Happy birthday!  
How much more can you take?  
But your friends are hungry  
So just cut the stupid cake  
  
Happy birthday!  
Happy birthday!  
Happy birthday, dear...


If you believe in Darwin's theory  
I'm not saying you have to but it's an interesting theory  
Darwin said we all evolve from monkeys  
If his theory is accurate and who am I to say?  
Does the opposite work going the other way?  
If it does I wanna devolve back to a monkey  
I wanna be a monkey that's for sure  
I wanna be a monkey like Curious George  
I would sit around all day just eating bananas  
I might be naked or just wear pyjamas  
And make my money appearing in hilarious movies  
Monkey see, monkey do  
That would be my excuse  
It's not my fault, I'm just a monkey who can see  
I wanna be a monkey, that'd be nice  
I wanna be a monkey, eating other monkey's lice  
When they say it's so easy that a monkey could do it  
I'd be more than happy to prove it  
Then you'd know for sure if it was easy or not  
And if you wanna see the home of Michael Jackson  
I could provide some simian distraction  
Cuz we all know monkeys are Michael's second biggest weakness  
I wanna be a monkey yes I do  
I wanna be a monkey and fling my poo  
I wanna be a monkey  
I'd be agape if I was an ape  
What a thrilla to be a gorilla  
It would rock to be a macaque  
I wanna be a monkey


When I was a kid I wanted to grow up and be cop in a province town or county  
I thought it would be great if someday I could only ever be a mountie  
I wanted to beat up crooks and make arrests because that's part of the
profession  
But now I sit on my horse and tell American tourists the Parliament's in
session  
I really don't look good in red and my stupid hat flies off my head in every
parade  
I'm young and strong and have no fear but now I'm spending my career in
motorcades  
  
I want to enforce the law, I want to wear normal clothes  
I don't want to have to smile for diplomats' home videos  
I good at working real hard, I should have joined the coast guard  
Oh no, the RCMP  
Is not the life for me  
  
I used to think that a mountie had to be honest, loyal, humble, strong and
thrifty  
But even though we don't break ranks, we get no thanks, they took us off the
fifty (dollar bill)  
On Sussex Drive in hallowed halls we act like guards in shopping malls, it's
such a pain  
Like someone's plotting the assassination of the Minister if Sports and
Recreation, oh that's insane  
Sometimes I just want to puke on Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, Dudley Do-
Right's such a jerk (Damn you, Snidely)  
And though he tries with all his heart, my horse couldn't catch a golfing
cart, some days I hate to go to work  
  
I want to enforce the law, I want to wear normal clothes  
I don't want to have to smile for diplomats' home videos  
I good at working real hard, I should have joined the coast guard  
Oh no, the RCMP  
Is not the life for me  
  
I want to enforce the law, I want to wear normal clothes  
I don't want to have to smile for diplomats' home videos

Oh no, the RCMP

Oh, no, it's not the life for me  
Oh, no, it's not the life for me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-
me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me, m-m-me


Come back proud canadian's,  
To before you had TV.  
No hockey night in canada,  
There was no CBC.  
  
In 1812 madison was mad,  
He was the president you know.  
Well he thought he'd tell the british where they ought to go.  
He thought he'd invade canada,  
He thought that he was tough.  
Instead we went to washington,  
And burned down all his stuff.  
  
And the white house burned, burned, burned.  
And we're the ones that did it,  
It burned, burned, burned.  
While the president ran and cried,  
It burned, burned, burned.  
And things were very historical,  
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa  
In the war of 1812.  
  
Those hilbilies from kentucky,  
Dressed in green and red.  
Left home to fight in canada,  
But they returned home dead.  
It's the only war the yankies lost except for veitnam.  
And also the alomo and the bay of ham.  
The looser was america,  
The winner was ourselfs.  
So join right in and gloat about the war of 1812.  
  
And the white house burned, burned, burned.  
And we're the ones that did it,  
It burned, burned, burned.  
While the president ran and cried,  
It burned, burned, burned.  
And things were very historical,  
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa  
In the war of 1812.  
  
In 1812 we were just sitting around,  
Minding our own business,  
Putting crops into the ground.  
We heard the soilders coming,  
And we didn't like that sound.  
So we took a boat to washington and burned it to the ground.  
  
Oh we fired our guns but the yankies kept on a coming,  
There wasn't quite as many as there was a while ago.  
We fired once more and the yankies started running,  
Down the mississippi to the gulf of mexico.  
They ran through the snow,  
And they ran through the forest,  
They ran through the bushes where the beavers wouldn't go,  
They ran so fast they forgot to take they're culture,  
Back to america, and gulf and mexico.  
  
So if you go to washington,  
It's building clean and nice,  
Bring a pack of matches,  
And we'll burn the white house twice.  
  
And the white house burned, burned, burned,  
But the americans wont admit it.  
It burned, burned, burned...  
It burned and burned and burned  
It burned, burned, burned  
I bet that made them mad.  
And the Americans ran and cried like a bunch of little babies WaWaWa  
In the war of 1812.


My father was a lawyer, mom's at university  
My brother and my sister, they both have their Ph.D.  
My grampa was a pilot shooting Nazis from t he sky  
But I am the most famous, I'm a TV weather guy  
  
He smiles at the camera and tells a little joke  
H e always says it's sunny if the telestrator's broke  
Thinks a meteorologist knows what falls from the sky  
But he's got a steady income as a TV weather guy  
  
They said that I'm not qualified to be on the TV  
Don't know Celsius from Fahrenheit so I just say degrees  
I just read the temperatures and make up a bunch of lies  
And end up being right more than the guy on channel five  
  
He smiles at the camera and tells a little joke  
He always says it's sunny if the telestrator's broke  
Thinks cloud are made from cotton that have blown up to the sky  
But he's got a steady income as a TV weather guy  
  
On Saturdays I must be out of bed by five A.M.  
Put on a ton of make-up and then stare at the camera lens  
Greeting all the viewers with a "Hi-hi-hip-hello!"  
'Cause it's the day I have to host a kiddie cartoon show  
  
He smiles at the camera then to his puppet sock  
He raves about the crayon drawings of the family dog  
Did a promo at the shopping mall and made the children cry  
He's a lousy clown but a good TV weather guy  
  
They said that I'm not cute enough to be an anchorman  
Not tough enough for sports and for the arts I was too bland  
But I know that some day I will reach my TV goal  
When I guest star on Baywatch or 90210  
  
'Til then I'll smile at the camera and tell a little joke  
He always says it's sunny if the telestrator's broke  
He wonders why big storms are always named for other guys  
But he's got a steady income as a TV weather guy  
He's got a steady income as a TV weather guy!


He was working at the record shop  
I would kiss him in the parking lot  
Tasting like cigarettes and soda pop  
Seventeen  
He would tell me I was beautiful  
Sneaking in the neighbor's swimming pool  
Yeah, he taught me how to break the rules  
Seventeen  
  
Hey, those days are long gone  
And when I hear this song it takes me back  
  
We were on top of the world  
Back when I was your girl  
We were living so wild and free  
Acting stupid for fun  
All we needed was love  
That's the way it's supposed to be  
Seventeen  
  
Stealing beers out of the trailer park  
Flicking lighters just to fight the dark  
My favorite place was sitting in his car  
Seventeen  
We laid a blanket on the roof top  
That time I knew I wouldn't make him stop  
The nights were cold but we kept 'em hot  
Seventeen  
  
Hey, those days are long gone  
And when I hear this song it takes me back  
  
We were on top of the world,  
Back when I was your girl  
We were living so wild and free  
Acting stupid for fun  
All we needed was love  
That's the way it's supposed to be  
  
We were running red lights  
We were going all night  
Didn't care about anything  
We were living our dream  
It was you and me  
And we were seventeen  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh...  
Seventeen  
Seventeen  
  
I remember what it felt like  
Just a small town kind of life  
If I could only just go back in time,  
Seventeen  
  
We were on top of the world  
Back when I was your girl  
We were living so wild and free  
Acting stupid for fun  
All we needed was love  
That's the way it's supposed to be  
  
We were running red lights  
We were going all night  
Didn't care about anything  
We were living our dream  
It was you and me  
And we were seventeen  
  
Seventeen  
Seventeen  
Seventeen


All the small things  
True care, truth brings  
I'll take one lift  
Your ride, best trip  
  
Always, I know  
You'll be at my show  
Watching, waiting  
Commiserating  
  
Say it ain't so, I will not go  
Turn the lights off, carry me home  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
  
Late night, come home  
Work sucks, I know  
She left me roses by the stairs  
Surprises let me know she cares  
  
Say it ain't so, I will not go  
Turn the lights off, carry me home  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na na  
  
Say it ain't so, I will not go  
Turn the lights off, carry me home  
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill  
The night will go on, my little windmill  
  
Say it ain't so, I will not go (na na na na na na na na na na)  
Turn the lights off, carry me home (na na na na na na na na na na)  
Keep your head still, I'll be your thrill (na na na na na na na na na na)  
The night will go on, the night will go on (na na na na na na na na na na)  
My little windmill


Sometimes I get so weird  
I even freak myself out  
I laugh myself to sleep  
It's my lullaby  
Sometimes I drive so fast  
Just to feel the danger  
I want to scream  
It makes me feel alive  
  
Is it enough to love?  
Is it enough to breathe?  
Somebody rip my heart out  
And leave me here to bleed  
Is it enough to die?  
Somebody save my life  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please  
  
To walk within the lines  
Would make my life so boring  
I want to know that I  
Have been to the extreme  
So knock me off my feet  
Come on now give it to me  
Anything to make me feel alive  
  
Is it enough to love?  
Is it enough to breath?  
Somebody rip my heart out  
And leave me here to bleed  
Is it enough to die?  
Somebody save my life  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please.  
  
Let down your defenses  
Use no common sense  
If you look you will see  
That this world is a beautiful  
Accident turbulent succulent  
Opulent permanent, no way  
I want to taste it  
Don't want to waste it away  
  
Sometimes I get so weird  
I even freak myself out  
I laugh my self to sleep  
It's my lullaby  
  
Is it enough?  
Is it enough?  
Is it enough to breath?  
Somebody rip my heart out  
And leave me here to bleed  
Is it enough to die?  
Somebody save my life  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please  
  
Is it enough?  
Is it enough to die?  
Somebody save my life  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please  
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please.

Uh huh, uh huh, that's the way it is  
'Cause life's like this  
Uh huh, uh huh that's the way it is  
  
Chill out, what you yellin' for?  
Lay back, it's all been done before  
And if you could only let it be  
You will see  
I like you the way you are  
When we're drivin' in your car  
And you're talking to me one on one  
But you've become  
  
Somebody else 'round everyone else  
You're watching your back like you can't relax  
You're tryin' to be cool  
You look like a fool to me  
Tell me  
  
Why do you have to go and make things so complicated?  
I see the way you're  
Acting like you're somebody else, gets me frustrated  
And life's like this you,  
You fall and you crawl and you break and you take what you get and you turn it
into  
Honesty, you promised me I'm never gonna find you fake it  
No, no, no  
  
You come over unannounced  
Dressed up like you're somethin' else  
Where you are ain't where it's at you see, you're making me  
Laugh out when you strike your pose  
Take off all your preppy clothes  
You know, you're not fooling anyone  
When you've become  
  
Somebody else 'round everyone else  
You're watchin' your back like you can't relax  
You're tryin' to be cool

When you're not here I don't know what to do  
I do not think that I can wait  
To go over and to talk to you  
I do not know what I should say  
  
And I walk out in silence  
That's when I start to realize  
What you bring to my life  
Damn, this guy can make me cry  
  
It's so contagious  
I cannot get it out of my mind  
It's so outrageous  
You make me feel so high  
All the time  
  
They all say that you're no good for me  
But I'm too close to turn around  
I'll show them they don't know anything  
I think I've got you figured out  
  
So I walk out in silence  
That's when I start to realize  
What you bring to my life  
Damn, this guy can make me smile  
  
It's so contagious  
I cannot get it out of my mind  
It's so outrageous  
You make me feel so high  
  
I'll give you everything  
I'll treat you right  
If you just give me a chance  
I can prove I'm right  
  
It's so contagious  
I cannot get it out of my mind  
It's so outrageous  
You make me feel so high  
It's so contagious  
I cannot get it out of my mind  
It's so outrageous  
You make me feel so high  
All the time


Please go away,  
Leave me alone.  
To you I have nothing to say,  
My voice has no tone.  
  
I'd rather be there,  
Because you're here.  
Whatever, I don't care,  
Because of you there was a tear.  
  
No one cares about me,  
No one needs me.  
But don't you see,  
I do whatever you do to me.  
  
Do you hate me,  
'cause I know I hate you.  
That's why I want you to stay away from me,  
You weren't the only one that I knew.  
  
Don't try to touch my feelings.  
Don't try to see what's on my mind.  
'cause the last thing I'd do is let you  
Back in my life. I despise you...


Destiny  
  
Searching for my destiny  
Not knowing where to look  
Searching all over the world  
Pointless, without a system  
  
Where is my destiny?  
Where and what is my destiny?  
You will always know  
That I'm looking for it with you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Is it in the sky?  
Under the sea or on the ground?  
In a wood or in the deserts?  
On a mountain or in a valley?  
  
Together we will find our destiny  
Together we will search  
All those years, looking  
All those years, pointless  
  
Why do I say it was pointless  
Looking for it with you  
I will give you the reason  
My destiny... Is you...


[Verse 1]  
Grains of sand slip through your hands  
Never seasing time  
Fold your hands in silent prayer  
Eternal peace you'll find  
  
[Chorus]  
Like two rivers flow  
To the open sea  
Someday we'll reunite  
For all eternity  
  
[Verse 2]  
Let the rain falling on your face  
Run into your eyes  
Can you see the rainbow now  
Through the stormy skies  
  
[Chorus] [x2]  
Like two rivers flow  
To the open sea  
Someday we'll reunite  
For all eternity  
  
[Verse 3]  
Standing in the rising tide  
Heaven's light shines on you, on you, on you  
Test the sea rising at your feet  
How far can you go  
'Till you need God's helping hand  
To ride the undertoe  
  
[Chorus][x3]  
Like two rivers flow  
To the open sea  
Someday we'll reunite  
For all eternity


Seeing you, walk right by me,  
Makes me think you really love me,  
Tell me, why is this going on?  
If you love me then please tell me,  
Is this unordinary?  
Is this extrordinary?  
Just please... Tell me... Don't go,  
Seeing the same places everyday,  
Let me go somewhere that I never been before,  
This is just more,  
Of my...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Everyday life,  
Seeing you everyday,  
Going to band on Mondays,  
With no limit anyomre,  
But nothing more, than my  
Everyday life,  
Partyin' on Wednesday nights,  
Going to my car on Friday mornings,  
Like an everyday story,  
  
Just go by the sound of my drummer drumming,  
And the sounds of the guitars slamming,  
Just... You should know,  
Sweetly walking to my locker,  
Open it up to find a note,  
Heres what he wrote:  
'Girl, I know you want me,  
If you do, come and get me,  
Be at the park, by sundown,  
When nobody else is around,  
Be there if you want me. '  
Signed no name,  
By the look in my eyes,  
I could tell it was him,  
He stared at me, with a grin,  
  
[Chorus:]  
This is my everyday life,  
Going through my pages  
Through the good and the bad times  
Why are you, sayin' to me,  
This ain't your everyday life girl,  
Your everyday life is you and me,  
My everyday life,  
  
Why go thorugh the pain,  
When the love and sorrow's just gonna drain,  
Now this is my everyday life.


You say you turned it off hid your heart upon a shelf  
Scared of what it might cost to take it down for sombody else  
Cause loving her you lost too much of yourself  
Baby can't you see that she's not me  
Not me at all  
  
And I need you to know you can fall into me  
That my arms are wide open and will always be  
Right here waiting staying strong come and fall into me  
Don't compare her to me, believe in love  
  
I'll follow any road anywhere to get to you  
I'll open up my soul if that is what you need me to do  
Now baby it's your move all you got to do is  
Believe in love just believe in us  
  
And I need you to know you can fall into me  
That my arms are wide open and will always be  
Right here waiting staying strong come and fall into me  
Just believe in love, just believe in us  
  
Just believe in love just believe in us  
  
Baby  
  
I need you to know you can fall into me  
That my arms are wide open and will always be  
Right here waiting staying strong come and fall into me  
Come and fall into me  
Baby fall into me


I looked away  
Then I looked back at you  
You tried to say  
Things that you can't undo  
If I had my way  
I'd never get over you  
Today's the day  
I pray that we make it through  
Make it through the fall  
Make it through it all  
  
[Chorus]  
And I don't want to fall to pieces  
I just want to sit and stare at you  
I don't want to talk about it  
And I don't want a conversation  
I just want to cry in front of you  
I don't want to talk about it  
'Cause I'm in love with you  
  
You're the only one  
I'd be with 'til the end  
When I come undone  
You bring me back again  
Back under the stars  
Back into your arms  
  
[Chorus]  
And I don't want to fall to pieces  
I just want to sit and stare at you  
I don't want to talk about it  
And I don't want a conversation  
I just want to cry in front of you  
I don't want to talk about it  
'Cause I'm in love with you  
  
Want to know who you are  
Want to know where to start  
I want to know what this means  
Want to know how you feel  
Want to know what is real  
I want to know everything, everything  
  
[Chorus]  
And I don't want to fall to pieces  
I just want to sit and stare at you  
I don't want to talk about it  
And I don't want a conversation  
I just want to cry in front of you  
I don't want to talk about it  
  
And I don't want to fall to pieces  
I just want to sit and stare at you  
I don't want to talk about it  
And I don't want a conversation  
I just want to cry in front of you  
I don't want to talk about it  
'Cause I'm in love with you  
  
I'm in love with you  
'Cause I'm in love with you  
I'm in love with you  
I'm in love with you


If fear's what makes us decide  
Our future journey  
Well I'm not along for the ride  
'Cause I'm still yearning  
  
To try and touch the sky  
My fingers burning  
Before you are old you're young  
Yeah I'm stilling learning  
  
I am falling down  
Try and stop me  
Feels so good to hit the ground  
You can watch me  
  
Fall right on my face  
It's an uphill human race  
And I, I am falling down  
  
I'm standing out in the street  
The earth is moving  
I feel it under my feet  
And I'm still proving  
  
That I can stand my ground  
And my feet are there  
Having washed my hair  
To be lost before you are found  
Don't mean you're losing  
  
I am falling down  
Try and stop me  
Feels so good to hit the ground  
You can watch me  
Fall right on my face  
It's an uphill human race  
And I, I am falling down  
  
Someday I'll live in a house  
Etc, etc, etc  
But you know that's not for now  
For now I'm falling down, down, down  
Down, down, down  
Down, down, down  
Yea, yeah, yeah  
  
I am falling down  
Try and stop me  
Feels so good to hit the ground  
You can watch me  
Falling right on my face  
It's an uphill human race  
And I, I am falling down  
I am falling down (falling, falling, falling)  
Feels so good to hit the ground  
(oh you're falling)


I woke up and saw the sun today  
You came by without a warning  
You put a smile on my face  
I want that for every morning  
  
What is it I'm feeling?  
'Cause I can't let it go  
If seeing is believing  
Then I already know  
  
I'm falling fast  
I hope this lasts  
I'm falling hard for you  
I say "let's take a chance"  
Take it while we can  
I know you feel it too  
  
I'm falling fast  
I'm falling fast  
  
It doesn't matter what we do  
You make everything seem brighter  
I never knew I needed you  
Like a sad time needs a sea of lighters  
  
What is it I'm feeling?  
'Cause I can't let it go  
If seeing is believing  
I already know  
  
I'm falling fast  
'Cause I hope this lasts  
'Cause I'm falling hard for you  
I say "let's take a chance"  
Take it while we can  
'Cause I know you feel it too  
  
I'm falling fast  
I'm falling fast  
  
I hope you know  
I hope it lasts  
I'm falling hard, I'm falling fast  
We can go, no holding back  
  
I'm falling fast  
I hope this lasts  
I'm falling hard for you  
I say "let's take a chance"  
Take it while we can  
I know you feel it too  
  
I'm falling fast  
I'm falling fast


Don't matter what people say  
I never did believe them  
I know, I know they know everything  
  
I'll be alright by myself  
And no one's gonna tell me I'm defined  
Confined by love  
  
Now our days seem strange  
I guess my heart was bound to change  
  
I fell out, out of you and me  
You're fading from view  
And you're falling into history  
I fell out, out of you and me  
You're fading from view  
And you're falling into history  
  
I never thought that I'd say  
That I don't really miss you  
I lived, I breathed your breath through me  
  
Time has a way of passing by  
Until I don't remember why  
Or how to hurt for you  
  
Love's pain has gone somewhere  
And I'm finally hanging it there  
  
I fell out, out of you and me  
You're fading from view  
And you're falling into history  
I fell out, out of you and me  
You're fading from view  
And you're falling into history  
  
Falling into,  
Falling into,  
You're falling into history  
  
I fell out, out of you and me  
You're fading from view  
And you're falling into history  
I fell out, out of you and me  
You're fading from view  
And you're falling into history  
  
I'll be alright by myself  
And no one's gonna tell me I'm defined  
Confined by love


I'm feeling sorry for myself,  
Every one is making fun of me.  
I have no friends,  
I'm a loner,  
And what else is there to do,  
But...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Feel sorry for myself,  
I'm feeling sorry for myself,  
I'm such a loner,  
I have no friends,  
What else is there to do,  
But feel sorry for myself,  
  
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, yeah yeah yeah [x2]  
  
No one likes me,  
I'm living on the streets,  
I have no parents,  
And I've split up with my band,  
What else is there to do,  
But...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Feel sorry for myself,  
I'm feeling sorry for myself,  
I'm such a loner,  
I have no friends,  
What else is there to do,  
But feel sorry for myself  
  
[Bridge:]  
Yeah yeah,  
I'm feeling,  
I'm feeling,  
I'm feeling sorry for myself,  
Yeah yeah,  
Yeah yeah,  
I'm feeling  
Feeling  
Sorry for myself  
  
[Chorus:]  
Feeling sorry for myself,  
Feeling sorry for myself,  
Nothing to do,  
Nothing else to  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Nothing else to do,  
Nothing else do but,  
  
Feel Sorry For Myself


[Verse 1]  
There's a light inside of all of us  
It's never hiding, you just have to light it  
It's the one thing that you gotta trust  
It's like a diamond, you just have to find it  
So if you ever feel like giving up  
Yeah, just remember that  
  
[Chorus]  
We were all meant to fly  
Spread your wings across the universe  
It's your time to  
It's your time to shine  
There's a light inside of all of us  
Soon you'll find that  
It's your time to fly  
Your time to fly  
  
[Verse 2]  
A little help is all it ever takes  
Somebody has to tell you it's worth fighting  
A single step becomes a leap of faith  
That's when you realize you started flying  
So don't you ever say you're giving up  
No, there's no looking back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Just reach up  
Don't give up  
Until you've touched the sky  
Just reach up  
Don't give up  
Until you've realized  
  
[Chorus - Variation]  
That we were all meant to fly  
Spread your wings across the universe  
It's your time to  
It's your time to shine  
There's a light inside of all of us  
Soon you'll find that  
It's your time to fly, fly  
It's you time to shine, shine  
Soon you'll find that  
It's your time to fly, fly  
(Spread your wings across the universe)  
It's your time to shine, shine  
(There's a light inside of all of us)  
Soon you'll find that  
It's your time to fly


I guess I was foolish to understand  
That fact that I'm leaving my life and starting all over again,  
  
One day sittin back looking at old memories,  
Thinkin bout those little things that you told me,  
But what if I wasn't jokin,  
They're all lookin at those who are provokin,  
Little things that worry me are about to end  
Just like you and me being friends  
If I knew that this was gonna happen,  
Then I would of just said,  
  
[Chorus:]  
The words 'foolish' and 'Leave me alone'  
Don't go together that's what you said to me on the phone  
But I don't think so, those are what I am.  
Sweet dreams little one is what he said,  
You're only foolish, that didn't go to my head  
As little as you are you want left alone  
Confusing as a dog that hates bones  
Most girls love attention but I don't.  
  
Think of me as a distraction  
Stoppping your work stopping your attraction  
Little as I know.  
I'm a girl who likes who no one would ever of dream of me thinking,  
Little as I don't know.  
Whatever caused me to stop the moment  
The moment when I wished say I love you.  
But my dreams go away  
  
[Chorus:]  
The words 'foolish' and 'Leave me alone'  
Don't go together that's what you said to me on the phone  
But I don't think so, those are what I am.  
Sweet dreams little one is what he said,  
You're only foolish, that didn't go to my head  
As little as you are you want left alone  
Confusing as a dog that hates bones  
Most girls love attention but I don't.  
  
We're newlyweds thirteen years later  
I'm dressed in a gown laying down,  
My dream didn't fade.


Ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah  
I'm giving up on everything  
Because you messed me up  
  
Don't know how much you  
You screwed it up  
You never listened  
That's just too bad  
  
Because I'm moving on  
I won't forget  
You were the one that was wrong  
I know I need to step up and be strong  
  
Don't patronize me  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
Have you forgotten  
Everything that I wanted  
Do you forget it now  
You never got It  
Do you get it now  
Yea yea yea yea yea  
  
Ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah  
  
Gotta get away  
There's no point in thinking about yesterday  
  
It's too late now  
It won't ever be the same  
We're so different now  
Yea yea yea yea yea  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know I want to run away  
I know I want to run away  
Run away  
  
If only I could run away  
If only I could run away  
Run away  
  
I told you what i wanted I  
I told you what i wanted  
What I wanted  
  
But I was forgotten  
I won't be forgotten  
Never Again  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Forgotten  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Forgotten  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Forgotten  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Forgotten  
Yeah yeah yeah


There's not much going on today  
I'm really bored, it's getting late  
What happened to my Saturday? (Saturday)  
Monday's coming, the day I hate, hate  
  
Sit on the bed alone (Bed alone)  
Staring at the phone  
  
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no  
He wouldn't even open up the door  
He never made me feel like I was special  
He isn't really what I'm looking for  
  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
This is when I start to bite my nails  
And clean my room when all else fails  
I think it's time for me to bail (Time to bail)  
This point of view is getting stale-ale  
  
Sit on the bed alone (Bed alone)  
Staring at the phone (At the phone)  
  
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought no  
He wouldn't even open up the door  
He never made me feel like I was special  
He isn't really what I'm looking for  
  
Uh, uh (hey, hey)  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh (hey, hey)  
Uh, uh, hey, hey  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh (hey, hey)  
  
Na, na, na, na, na (we've all got choices)  
Na, na, na ,na (we've all got voices)  
Na, na, na, na, na (stand up make some noise)  
Na, na, na, na (stand up make some noise)  
  
Sit on the bed alone  
Staring at the phone  
  
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought no  
He wouldn't even open up the door  
He never made me feel like I was special  
He isn't really what I'm looking for  
  
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought no  
He wouldn't even open up the door  
He never made me feel like I was special  
Like I was special, 'cause I was special  
  
Uh, uh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh  
Uh, uh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh  
Na, na, na, na, na

Singing Radiohead at the top of our lungs

Cut the skin to the bone  
Fall asleep all alone  
Hear your voice in the dark  
Lose myself in your eyes  
Choke my voice Say goodnight  
As the world falls apart  
Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go  
I need some more time to fix this  
  
Here's a letter for you  
But the words get confused  
And the conversation dies  
Apologize for the past  
Talk some shit take it back  
Are we cursed to this life  
  
Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go  
I need some more time to fix this problem  
I need some more time to fix this problem  
I need some more time to fix this  
  
I'm talking to the ceiling  
My life just lost all meaning  
Do one thing for me tonight  
I'm dying in this silence  
  
The last star left in heaven  
Is falling down to earth and  
Do you still feel the same way  
Do you still feel the same way  
  
Fuck I can't let this kill me, let go  
I need some more time to fix this problem  
I need some more time to fix this problem  
I need some more time to fix this


Far off into the distance  
Holding on inside  
Nobody to hear me scream  
Nobody to hear me cry  
Too close to no nobody  
Too far to hold onto life  
There's nowhere to run  
And onwhere to hide  
  
Hold onto yourself  
Hold onto the life that u live  
Hold onto me  
And neva let go  
Don't be afraid  
To face the dangers each day  
Hold onto me  
And neva let go  
  
Too heavy to fly away  
Too light to try to die  
Too false to live no truth  
Too trughful to deny  
Too weak to live  
Too strong to hold back now  
Too many answers  
To ask the qusetion how  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't deny that u live  
Don't deny that u breathe  
Just hold onto me  
Don't lie 'cos ur real  
Don't lie u can deal with this  
Hold onto me  
  
[Chorus][x2]


I'm not afraid of anything,  
I just need to know that I can breathe  
And I don't need much of anything  
But suddenly suddenly  
  
I am small and the world is big  
All around me is fast moving  
Surrounded by so many things  
Suddenly suddenly,  
  
[Chorus]  
How does it feel to be  
Different from me  
Are we the same  
How does it feel?  
How does it feel to be  
Different from me  
Are we the same  
How does it feel?  
  
I am Young and I am free  
But I get tired and I get weak  
I get lost and I can't sleep  
But suddenly suddenly  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Would you comfort me...  
Would you cry with me...  
Uh-uh-oh-oh uh-oh uh-oh [Repeat: x2]  
  
I am small and the world is big  
But I'm not afraid of anything  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
Your different from me  
Different [Repeat: x3]  
  
Your different from me...


Every now and then we all want something  
Even if there's no way of gettin' it  
If i stomach that that's the way it must be  
Be the way around it, could I get myself around it  
  
Get me what I want  
Everything that I got  
Get me what I want  
Cause I'm a big shot  
  
don't want to always have to be so nice  
don't want to hear you say well that's just life  
I dry out when I open my mouth  
I make my way around it, make my way around it  
  
Get me what I want  
Everything that I got  
Get me what I want  
Cause I'm a big shot  
  
So give me what I want  
I always get what I want  
don't want to see me red  
If I don't get what I want  
that's not what you want  
  
I'm not about to take no for an answer  
no  
If I tell you I can't I'm still gonna go  
I did it all by myself  
I found my way around it  
  
Get me what I want  
Everything that I got  
Get me what I want  
Cause I'm a big shot  
So give me what I want  
I always get what I want  
don't want to see me red  
If I don't get what I want  
that's not what you want  
  
It's not to lovely  
It could start to get ugly  
It really bugs me  
  
Get me what I want  
Everything that I got  
Get me what I want  
Cause I'm a big shot  
So give me what I want  
I always get what I want  
don't want to see me red  
If I don't get what I want  
that's not what you want  


La, la  
la, la, la, la  
la, la  
la, la, la  
  
I like your smile  
I like your vibe  
I like your style  
But that's not why I love you  
And I, I like the way, you're such a star  
But that's not why I love you, hey  
  
Do you feel,  
do you feel me,  
do you feel what I feel too  
Do you need,  
do you need me,  
do you need me  
  
You're so beautiful  
But that's not why I love you  
I'm not sure you know  
That the reason I love you, is you  
  
Being you, just you  
yeah the reason I love you  
Is all that we've been through  
And that's why I love you  
  
La, la  
la, la, la, la  
la, la  
la, la, la  
  
I like the way you misbehave  
When we get wasted  
But that's not why I love you  
And how you keep your cool when I am complicated  
But that's not why I love you, hey  
  
Do you feel,  
do you feel me,  
do you feel what I feel too  
Do you need,  
do you need me,  
do you need me  
  
You're so beautiful  
But that's not why I love you  
And I'm not sure you know  
That the reason I love you, is you  
Being you, just you  
yeah the reason I love you  
Is all that we've been through  
And that's why I love you  
  
yeah, oh, oh, oh,  
oh, oh, oh, oh  
Even though we didn't make it through  
I am always here for you  
yeah,  
  
oh you're so beautiful  
But that's not why I love you  
I'm not sure you know  
That the reason I love you, is you  
Being you, just you  
now the reason I love you  
Is all that we've been through  
And that's why I love you  
  
La la, la la la la (oh, oh)  
La la, la la la la (that's why I love you)  
La la, la la la la (oh, oh)  
La la, la la la la (that's why I love you)


There's nothing I can say to you  
Nothing I could ever do to make you see  
What you mean to me  
All the pain the tears I cried  
Still you never said goodbye and now I know how far you'd go  
I know I let you down but its not like that now  
This time I'll never let you go  
  
I will be all that you want and get my self together  
'Cause you keep me from falling apart  
All my life I'll be with you forever  
To get you through the day and make every thing OK  
  
I thought that I had every thing I didn't know what life could bring  
But now I see honestly  
You're the one thing I got right  
The only one I let inside  
Now I can breathe 'cause you're here with me  
And if I let you down I'll turn it all around  
Cause I would never let you go  
  
I will be all that you want and get my self together  
'Cause you keep me from falling apart  
All my life I'll be with you forever  
To get you through the day and make every thing OK  
  
'Cause with out you I can't sleep  
I'm not gonna ever ever let you leave  
You're all I got  
You're all I want  
Yeah  
And with out you I don't know what I'll do  
I could never ever live a day with out you  
Here with me do you see you're all I need  
  
And I will be all that you want and get my self together  
'Cause you keep me from falling apart  
All my life (my life) I will be with you forever  
To get you through the day and make every thing OK  
  
I will be (I'll be) all that you want and get my self together  
'Cause you keep me from falling apart  
And all my life you know I will be with you forever  
To get you through the day and make every thing OK


Outside the carolers start to sing  
I can't descibe the joy they bring  
'Cause joy is something they don't bring me  
  
My boifriend is by my side  
From the roof are hanging sickles of ice  
Their whiny voices get irritating  
It's Christmas time again  
  
So I stand with a dead smile on my face  
Wondering how much of my time they'll waste  
Oh God, I hate these Satan's helpers  
  
And then I guess I must have snapped  
Because I grabbed the baseball bat  
And made them all run for shelter  
  
It's Christmas time again  
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand  
All year  
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer  
You people scare me  
Please stay away from my home  
If you don't wanna get beat down  
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone  
  
Well, I guess it's not cool to freak on Christmas Eve  
Cause the cops came and arrested me  
They had an unfair advantage  
And even though the jail didn't have a tree  
Christmas came a night early  
Cause a guy named bubba unwrapped my package  
  
It's Christmas time again  
It's time to be nice to the people you can't stand  
All year  
I'm growing tired of all this Christmas cheer  
You people scare me  
Please stay away from my home  
If you don't wanna get beat down  
Just leave the presents and then leave me alone  
  
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas  
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas  
(Please post my bail)  
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas  
(Please post my bail)  
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas  
(Please post my bail)  
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas  
(Please post my bail)  
I won't be home, I won't be home for Christmas


I got no regret right now (I'm feeling this)  
The air is so cold and low (I'm feeling this)  
Let me go in his room (I'm feeling this)  
I want to take off his clothes (I'm feeling this)  
Show me the way to bed (I'm feeling this)  
Show me the way you move (I'm feeling this)  
Fuck it, it's such a blur (I'm feeling this)  
I love all the things you do (I'm feeling this)  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
I'll leave when I wanna  
  
Where do we go from here  
Turn all the lights down now  
Smiling from ear to ear (I'm feeling this)  
Our breathing has got too loud (I'm feeling this)  
Show me the bedroom floor (I'm feeling this)  
Show me the bathroom mirror (I'm feeling this)  
Were taking this way too slow (I'm feeling this)  
Take me away from here (I'm feeling this)  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
I'll leave when I wanna  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
I'll leave when I wanna  
  
This place was never the same again  
After you came and went  
How can you say you meant anything different  
To anyone standing alone on the street  
With a cigarette on the first night we met  
  
Look to the past and remember your smile  
And maybe tonight I can breathe for awhile  
I'm not in this scene I think I'm falling asleep  
But then all that it means is I'll always be dreaming of you  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
I'll leave when I wanna  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
I'll leave when I wanna  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
I'll leave when I wanna  
  
Fate fell short this time  
Your smile fades in the summer  
Place your hand in mine  
I'll leave when I wanna  
  
(Are we alone, do you feel it, so lost and disillusioned)


Do you ever feel  
So perfect  
You're not for real  
But it's worth it  
It seems like  
Evrybody's friends  
And in time  
You know that this will end  
  
But you're not thinking of how it should be done  
So maybe you're losing your mind  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I can think of a thousand places  
That I know I could be  
But it's just one of those days  
When I'm hopeless and useless but happy  
  
Do you ever work out  
How it could be done  
I ain't got a doubt  
I know this is the one  
And if you feel  
Like nothing will change  
Stay for real  
Reality's not out of your range  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Another milestone  
Or maybe not so  
But still you can turn  
You can burn  
Or just go  
But it all  
Fills up  
In the end  
  
[Chorus][x2]  
Do you ever feel  
So perfect  
You're not for real  
But it's worth it  
  
In the end


Kiss Me out of the bearded barley,  
Nightly, beside the green green grass.  
Swing, swing, swing the spinning step,  
You wear those shoes and I will wear that dress.  
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight,  
Lead me out on the moonlit floor.  
Lift your open hand,  
Strike up the band and make the fire flies dance,  
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me.  
  
Kiss me down by the broken tree house,  
Swing me upon it's hanging tire.  
Bring, bring, bring your flowered hat,  
We'll take the trail marked on your father's map.  
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight,  
Lead me out on the moonlit floor.  
Lift your open hand,  
Strike up the band and make the fire flies dance,  
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me.  
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la  
Oh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight,  
Lead me out on the moonlit floor.  
Lift your open hand,  
Strike up the band and make the fire flies dance,  
Silver moon's sparkling, so kiss me.  
Now kiss me  
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la


Oooohh oooohhh  
  
  
Momma take this badge off of me  
I can't use it anymore  
It's getting dark, too dark to see  
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door  
  
Chorus:  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
  
  
Momma put my guns in the ground  
I can't shoot them anymore  
That long black cloud is coming down  
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door  
  
Chorus:  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
(yaaa yaaa)  
Knock knock knockin' on heaven's door  
  
  
Ooooooooooooohhhhhh


Hey, yea, ohoh (3x)  
  
I've only got 3 dollars left in my hands,  
I walk down the sidewalk as I pass a dirty man  
Walk up the staircase that leads to my hotel  
I'm living in at a fancy hotel, yeayea  
Then I'll go up to my room  
Fixate on what's the deal  
I'm alone again  
Then I will crawl into the bed,  
And call you up to tell you off  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause I'm on my own, would you leave me alone  
Before I lose my mind  
Because you lied and so did I  
Oh oh oh, would you cry-y-y  
If I let you go tonight if I let you go tonight  
Yea, yea, let go  
  
Hey, yea, ohoh  
  
I'll probably wake up a little sad  
But then I'll get up and let go of it all instead  
Because really it's not worth it  
To get in a mess over him  
To bother get stressed over him  
So I'll just go on with my life  
And fixate on everything else but you  
Yea I'll just go on with my life  
I have no reason to please you anymore  
  
'Cause I'm on my own, would you leave me alone  
Before I lose my mind  
Because you lied and so did I  
Oh oh oh, would you cry-y-y  
If I let you go tonight if I let you go  
  
So find your way out of my sight  
I know it's hard, it's tough to laugh  
It's all messed up, don't play this game  
  
[Chorus:] 2x  
  
Yea, yea  
Getting stressed over you  
Getting messed over you


Are you aware of what  
You make me feel, baby  
Right now I feel invisible to you  
Like I'm not real  
Didn't you feel me lock my arms around you  
Why'd you turn away  
Here's what I have to say  
  
I was left to cry there  
Waiting outside there  
Grinning with the lost stare  
That's when I decided  
  
Why should I care  
'Cause you weren't there  
When I was scared  
I was so alone  
  
You, you need to listen  
I'm startin' to trip  
I'm losing my grip  
And I'm in this thing alone  
(oh oh yeah)  
  
Am I just some chick  
You placed beside you  
To take somebody's place?  
When you turn around  
  
Can you recognize my face?  
You used to love me  
You used to hug me  
But that wasn't the case  
Everything wasn't ok  
  
I was left to cry there  
Waiting outside there  
Grinning with a lost stare  
That's when I decided  
  
Why should I care  
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared  
I was so alone  
You, you need to listen  
I'm starting to trip  
I'm losing my grip  
And I'm in this thing alone  
  
Crying out loud  
I'm crying out loud  
Crying out loud  
I'm crying out loud  
Open your eyes  
Open up wide  
  
Why should I care  
Cause you weren't there when I was scared  
I was so alone  
Why should I care  
  
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared  
I was so alone  
Why should I care  
If you don't care then I don't care  
  
We're not going anywhere  
Why should I care  
'Cause you weren't there when I was scared  
I was so alone  
  
Why should I care  
If you don't care then I don't care  
We're not going anywhere


Layin' on the couch just,  
Hangin' with my boys  
We're chillin' up the house tonight  
I'm being myself  
I'm nobody else 'cause  
This is what we do alright  
You'll always find  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm not wearing any make-up,  
Won't hide who I am,  
I'll be what I am  
I'm just being honest with my self once again  
I'm my only friend  
  
Kickin' off my shoes  
I'm strummin' my guitar  
I'm singin' songs about my life  
If I could tell the truth  
I'd tell you what I meant by  
Me, myself, and I  
You'll always find  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No more mirrors  
No more vanity  
Give it all away for free  
Donate to charity  
I am happy in my skin  
I try, in my heart it's not the same  
You'll always find  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lay on my couch, hang with my boys, chill at my house tonight,  
Lay on my couch, hang with my boys, chill at my house tonight,  
Lay on my couch, hang with my boys, chill at my house tonight,  
Lay on my couch, hang with my boys, chill at my house tonight


I wake up in the morning  
Put on my face  
The one that's gonna get me  
Through another day  
Doesn't really matter  
How I feel inside  
'Cause life is like a game sometimes  
  
But then you came around me  
The walls just disappeared  
Nothing to surround me  
And keep me from my fears  
I'm unprotected  
See how I've opened up  
Oh, you've made me trust  
  
Because I've never felt like this before  
I'm naked  
Around you  
Does it show?  
You see right through me  
And I can't hide  
I'm naked  
Around you  
And it feels so right  
  
I'm trying to remember  
Why I was afraid  
To be myself and let the  
Covers fall away  
I guess I never had someone like you  
To help me, to help me fit  
In my skin  
  
I never felt like this before  
I'm naked  
Around you  
Does it show?  
You see right through me  
And I can't hide  
I'm naked  
Around you  
And it feels so right  
  
I'm naked  
Oh oh yeah  
Does it show?  
Yeah, I'm naked  
Oh oh, yeah yeah  
  
I'm so naked around you  
And I can't hide  
You're gonna see right through, baby


I'm sorry if this hurts you,  
But I tried to keep what we had once,  
I was wrong it wasn't keeping me awake,  
  
You didn't listen, you didn't listen  
You didn't hear me, you didn't hear me  
When I said I want more, I got no more  
You weren't stealing me away  
  
Oh it's not enough,  
It's not enough to give me what it is I want  
It's not enough,  
It's not enough to get me, everything I need  
And I, I wish it was  
I think it's time to give this up  
  
All, all, all, all  
All, all, all, all, all  
All the memories that we're losing  
All the time that I spent with you everyday  
I think is running down the drain  
  
I'm feeling (feelin') that we're fading  
Don't make this as hard as you think it would be  
It's a lot easier than it seems yeah  
  
It's not enough,  
It's not enough to give me what it is I want  
It's not enough,  
It's not enough to get me, everything I need  
And I, I wish it was  
I think it's time to give this up  
  
And I can feel we're falling down slowly, slowly  
I can see us starting to drown, can't stop it now  
I can see we're burning out  
So show me, show me  
How you gonna turn it around?  
Because  
  
It's not enough  
Its not enough to give me what it is I want  
It's not enough  
Its not enough to get me everything I need  
It's not enough  
Its not enough to give me what it is I want  
It's not enough  
Its not enough to get me everything I need  
And I wish it was  
I think its time to give this up  
  
It's not enough  
It's not enough to give me what it is I want  
It's not enough  
It's not enough to get me everything I need  
It's not enough  
It's not enough to give me what it is I want  
It's not enough  
It's not enough to get me


He'd already asked for my number  
When will he call?, I wonder  
I'd give it away on a Friday  
I haven't heard a friggin' now it's Wednesday  
I don't know what he's thinking,  
He can leave me alone and I'll be waiting  
I don't think so  
There's other fish in the sea  
Who would love to swim with me  
  
You're not the only one  
Out there for me,  
And I know (and I know),  
You're not the only one  
Who's gonna be  
For me (for me)  
  
There's other fishes in the sea  
There's other fishes in the sea  
  
You finally called and I'm not home  
Don't even bother at all  
Can't remember what he looks like  
It's been 14 days, that's not my type  
I know they're not all like that  
There's gotta be some that don't think they're all that  
Yes I know so,  
There's other fish in the sea  
Who would love to swim with me  
  
You're not the only one  
Out there for me,  
And I know (and I know),  
You're not the only one  
Who's gonna be  
For me (for me)  
  
There's other fishes in the sea  
There's other fishes in the sea (in the sea)  
There's other fishes in the sea  
There's other fishes in the sea (fishes in the sea)  
  
You're not the only one  
Out there for me,  
And I know (and I know),  
You're not the only one  
Who's gonna be (be)  
For me (for me)  
  
You're not the only one  
(There's other fishes in the sea)  
You're not the only one  
(There's other fishes in the sea)  
You're not the only one  
(There's other fishes in the sea)  
You're not the only one  
(There's other fishes in the sea)


La la la, la la la la  
  
I know your kind of girl  
You only care about one thing  
"Who you've seen, or where you've been?"  
"Who's got money?"  
  
I see that look in your eyes  
It tells a million lies  
But deep inside, I know why  
You're talking to him  
  
I know what you're all about  
I really hope he figures it out  
  
[Chorus]  
She's one of those girls  
They're nothing but trouble  
Just one look and now you're seeing double  
Before you know it she'll be gone  
Off to the next one  
She's so good that you won't see it comin'  
She'll take you for a ride, and you'll be left with nothing  
You'll be broke, and she'll be gone  
Off to the next one  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Off to the next one  
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, oh, oh  
  
She's gonna be the end of you  
At least that's what they say  
It's been a while  
You're in denial  
And now it's too late  
The way she looks makes you hide  
All the warning signs  
'Cause her blond hair, her blue eyes  
Makes you wanna die  
  
I know what she's all about  
I really hope you figure it out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know it's a game, you know it's a game  
She keeps playing around with your head  
Playing around with your head  
She's so insane, so insane  
She's the one to blame, she's the one to blame  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Off to the next one  
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah  
Off to the next one


Remember when I cried to you a thousand times  
I told you everything  
You know my feelings  
It never crossed my mind  
That there would be a time  
For us to say goodbye  
What a big surprise  
  
But I'm not lost  
I'm not gone  
I haven't forgot  
  
These feelings I can't shake no more  
These feelings are running out the door  
I can feel it falling down  
And I'm not coming back around  
These feelings I can't take no more  
This emptiness in the bottom drawer  
It's getting harder to pretend  
And I'm not coming back around again  
  
Remember when  
  
I remember when it was together till the end  
Now I'm alone again  
Where do I begin?  
I cried a little bit  
You died a little bit  
Please say there's no regrets  
And say you won't forget  
But I'm not lost  
And I'm not gone  
I haven't forgot  
  
These feelings I can't shake no more  
These feelings are running out the door  
I can feel it falling down  
And I'm not coming back around  
These feelings I can't take no more  
This emptiness in the bottom drawer  
It's getting harder to pretend  
And I'm not coming back around again  
  
Remember when  
That was then  
Now it's the end  
I'm not coming back  
I can't pretend  
Remember when  
  
These feelings I can't shake no more  
These feelings are running out the door  
I can feel it falling down  
And I'm not coming back around  
These feelings I can't take no more  
This emptiness in the bottom drawer  
It's getting harder to pretend  
And I'm not coming back around again


Let them know that we're still rock n roll  
I don't care about my makeup  
I like it better with my jeans all ripped out  
Don't know how to keep my mouth shut  
You say so what  
(What)  
  
I don't care if I'm misfit  
I like it better then the hipster of all shit  
I am the mother fucking princess  
You still love me  
  
Some some how  
It's a little different when  
I'm with you  
You know what I really am  
On the phone  
You know how it really goes  
(Oh oh oh oh yeh)  
  
Some some way  
We'll be getting out of this  
Time one day  
You're the only one that I  
Want with me  
You know how the story goes  
(Oh oh oh)  
  
When it's you and me  
We don't need no one to tell us who to be  
We'll keep turning up the radio  
Well it's you and I  
Just put up  
A middle finger to the sky  
That them know that we're still rock n roll  
  
Rock n roll  
Hey hey hey  
Rock n roll  
Hey hey hey


Boy, you get me so high  
Buzzin' like a beehive  
It's just a little kiss  
But when It hits my lips  
I'm sippin' on sunshine  
Boy you're looking so fly  
Hotter than July  
I just wanna stay  
Forever and today  
Sippin' on sunshine  
  
Down at the beach, you holding my hand  
Got an umbrella stuck in the sand  
Watching the waves crash into the shore  
Baby, I want some more  
  
Hey  
What a beautiful day  
All I need is a taste  
Nothin' but a good time  
Sippin' on sunshine  
No, don't got nowhere to go  
So we'll go with the flow  
Yeah, we're living the life  
Sippin' on sunshine  
  
Sippin' on sunshine  
  
Boy, you blow my mind  
You got me up on cloud nine  
Just a little taste  
I wouldn't wanna waste  
A sip of that sunshine  
  
We can kick it all night  
Underneath the moonlight  
But when the party ends  
We'll do it all again  
Sippin' on sunshine  
  
Down at the beach, you holding my hand  
Got an umbrella stuck in the sand  
Watching the waves crash into the shore  
Baby, I want some more  
  
Hey  
What a beautiful day  
All I need is a taste  
Nothin' but a good time  
Sippin' on sunshine  
No, don't got nowhere to go  
So we'll go with the flow  
Yeah, we're living the life  
Sippin' on sunshine  
  
Sippin' on sunshine, sippin' on sunshine...  
Sippin' on sunshine, sippin' on sunshine...  
  
Hey  
What a beautiful day  
All I need is a taste (a taste so good)  
Nothin' but a good time (good time)  
Sippin' on sunshine  
No, don't got nowhere to go (do, don't)  
So we'll go with the flow (hell yeah)  
Yeah, we're living the life  
Sippin' on sunshine  
  
All day all night  
Yeah, good time  
Everybody just sippin' on sunshine  
  
Woah, woah, woah,  
Sippin' on sunshine


He was a boy  
She was a girl  
Can I make it any more obvious  
He was a punk  
  
She did ballet  
What more can I say  
He wanted her  
She'd never tell secretly she wanted him as well  
  
But all of her friends  
Stuck up their nose  
They had a problem with his baggy clothes  
  
He was a skater boy  
She said see you later boy  
He wasn't good enough for her  
She had a pretty face  
But her head was up in space  
She needed to come back down to earth  
  
Five years from now  
She sits at home  
Feeding the baby she's all alone  
She turns on t.v  
  
Guess who she sees  
Skater boy rockin' up MTV  
She calls up her friends  
They already know  
  
And they've all got  
Tickets to see his show  
She tags along  
Stands in the crowd  
Looks up at the man that she turned down  
  
He was a skater boy  
She said see you later boy  
He wasn't good enough for her  
Now he's a super star  
Slamming on his guitar  
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?  
  
He was a skater boy  
She said see you later boy  
He wasn't good enough for her  
Now he's a super star  
Slamming on his guitar  
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?  
  
Sorry girl but you missed out  
Well tough luck that boy's mine now  
We are more than just good friends  
This is how the story ends  
  
Too bad that you couldn't see,  
See the man that boy could be  
There is more that meets the eye  
I see the soul that is inside  
  
He's just a boy  
And I'm just a girl  
Can I make it any more obvious  
We are in love  
Haven't you heard  
How we rock each others world  
  
I'm with the skater boy  
I said see you later boy  
I'll be back stage after the show  
I'll be at the studio  
Singing the song we wrote  
About a girl you used to know  
  
I'm with the skater boy  
I said see you later boy  
I'll be back stage after the show  
I'll be at the studio  
Singing the song we wrote  
About a girl you used to know


I miss you, miss you so bad  
I don't forget you, oh it's so sad  
I hope you can hear me  
I remember it clearly  
  
The day you slipped away  
Was the day I found it won't be the same  
Ooh  
  
Nah nah la la la nah nah  
  
I didn't get around to kiss you  
Goodbye on the hand  
I wish that I could see you again  
I know that I can't  
  
Ooh  
I hope you can hear me cause I remember it clearly  
  
The day you slipped away  
Was the day I found it won't be the same  
Ooh  
  
I had my wake up  
Won't you wake up  
I keep asking why  
And I can't take it  
It wasn't fake  
It happened, you passed by  
  
Now your gone, now your gone  
There you go, there you go  
Somewhere I can't bring you back  
Now your gone, now your gone  
There you go, there you go,  
Somewhere your not coming back  
  
The day you slipped away  
Was the day I found it won't be the same no  
The day you slipped away  
Was the day that I found it won't be the same ooh  
  
Nah nah, nah nah nah, nah nah  
I miss you

You know that I'm a crazy bitch  
I do what I want when I feel like it  
All I wanna do is lose control (oh, oh)  
But you don't really give a shit  
You go with it, go with it, go with it  
'Cause you're fucking crazy rock n' roll  
  
You said hey  
What's your name  
It took one look  
And now I'm not the same  
Yeah you said hey  
And since that day  
You stole my heart  
And you're the one to blame  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah, and that's why I smile  
It's been a while  
Since every day and everything has  
Felt this right  
And now you turn it all around  
And suddenly you're all I need  
  
The reason why  
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh  
  
Last night I blacked out I think  
What did you, what did you put in my drink  
I remember making out and then (oh, oh)  
I woke up with a new tattoo  
Your name was on me and my name was on you  
I would do it all over again  
  
You said hey (hey)  
What's your name (what's your name)  
It took one look  
And now I'm not the same  
Yeah you said hey (hey)  
Since that day (since that day)  
You stole my heart  
And you're the one to blame  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The reason why  
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh  
The reason why  
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh  
  
You know that I'm a crazy bitch  
I do what I want when I feel like it  
All I wanna do is lose control  
You know that I'm a crazy bitch  
I do what I want when I feel like it  
All I wanna do is lose control  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The reason why  
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh  
The reason, the reason why  
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh  
  
The reason why  
I, I, I, I smile, oh oh oh


I woke up this morning  
Knowing it had to end  
That useless calling  
Don't you know it drives me round the bend  
  
If honesty speaks truth  
I've said to many lies  
I'm tied up just let me loose  
I just can't decide  
  
'cause i wanted someone to come along  
And make me feel too damn good  
But baby you're average and I've had to much of that kind  
And I don't think I should  
And I just wish  
  
[CHORUS]  
You would  
Not be  
So good  
To me  
Then I  
Wouldn't  
Guess I  
Shouldn't  
And then  
Breaking us apart  
Wouldn't be so hard  
  
Stop making  
Doing  
This  
So damn  
Hard . . .


Oh, how I wish that they would last  
Moments of peace that just slip through me so fast  
Just when I think that they are gonna stay  
Everything inside me just starts fading away  
  
Sometimes it seems like all I hope for  
Just gets thrown down on the floor  
And then it seems like you don't love me anymore  
Sometimes I wish that I could run away  
Sometimes I wish I just had something to say  
  
He looks at me and doesn't know the words to say  
But it's not you, I just don't feel quite right today  
All these things I say and do were never planned  
But how the fuck am I supposed to make you understand that  
  
Sometimes it seems like all I hope for  
Just gets thrown down on the floor  
And then it seems like you don't love me anymore  
Sometimes I wish that I could run away  
Sometimes I wish I just had something to say


I saw you last night,  
Down at the mere  
I saw your hands were playing gently with her hair  
I see you and I, in my mirror  
I close my eyes and wish that you could be here  
It's my fantasy to have you holding me, baby  
Going privately crazy  
Do you know what you do with me  
  
[Chrous]  
Stay, make my blue moon bright for a change  
Make my dreams end right  
Don't stay, afraid  
Be the one  
  
(yea, eyeyey)  
  
Get out of my head, get into my heart  
Be for real, are you fictional or real,  
I made up this lie, I made up this life  
When I'm alone it's like you're right here by my side  
It's my fantasy to have you here with me, baby  
Going privately crazy  
If you came I know just what I'd say  
  
Stay, make my blue moon bright for a change  
Make my world turn right  
Don't stay, afraid  
Be the one  
  
(heye, yeyeyeye)  
  
It's my fantasy to have you all to me, baby  
I'm going privately crazy  
Do you know what you do with me  
  
Stay, make my blue moon bright for a change  
Make my dreams end right  
Don't stay, afraid  
Be the one


All this talking to you  
I don't know what I'm to do  
I don't know where you stand  
What's inside of your head  
  
All this thinkin' of you  
Is that what you're doin' too  
You're always on my mind  
I talk about you all of the time  
  
Don't waste another day  
Don't waste another minute

Just to show you how much I'm in it  
So open up your heart  
Help me understand  
Please tell me who you are  
So I could show you who I am  
  
You're just standing by  
You're just wasting time  
Why don't you just tell me the truth about me and you  
And as the time goes by  
I hope you realize  
If you ask me to  
I just might be with you  
  
So don't waste another day  
Don't waste another minute  
I can't wait to see your face  
Just to show you how much I'm in it  
Open up your heart  
Help me understand  
Please tell me who you are  
So I could show you who I am  
  
Stop standing there, standing there  
And stop acting like you don't care  
And stop being scared, being scared  
Stop acting like you don't care  
  
So, don't waste another day  
Don't waste another minute  
I can't wait to see your face  
Just to show you how much I'm in it  
Open up your heart  
Help me understand

Please tell me who you are  
So I could show you who I am  
  
Who I am,  
Who I am,  
Who I am


Just take it take it.  
Just take it take it.  
  
I know what you do,  
Flash me.  
The way it's done,  
Impolitely.  
Just tying to find,  
Some alone time.  
No room to compromise.  
  
Just take it take it.  
Can't take it take it.  
  
She sent your picture to a magazine,  
And baby's aren't true photography.  
Is that what you always wanted to be,  
Well I'd be worried for you.  
  
Sometimes,  
Gotta try,  
Run and hide,  
Get away from this.  
I'll get by,  
In this life,  
This time.  
  
Take your best shot,  
And press me.  
Write a fictional story,  
For your fee.  
Try to get the world,  
To believe.  
Shocking hell I surprise.  
  
Just take it take it.  
Can't just take it take it.  
  
She sent your picture to a magazine,  
And baby's aren't true photography.  
Is that what you always wanted to be,  
Well I'd be sorry for you.  
  
Sometimes,  
Gotta try,  
Run and hide,  
Get away from this.  
I'll get by,  
In this life,  
This time.  
  
You see me,  
I see you.  
You're over there.  
You see me,  
I see you.  
  
She sent your picture to a magazine,  
And baby's aren't true photography.  
Is that what you always wanted to be,  
Well I'd be sorry for you.  
  
Sometimes,  
Gotta try to,  
Run and hide,  
Get away from shit.  
Sometimes,  
Gotta try,  
Run and hide,  
Get away from this.


I cannot find a way  
To describe it  
It's there  
Inside  
  
All I do is hide  
I wish  
That it  
Would just go away  
  
What would  
You do?  
You do?  
If you knew  
What would you do?  
  
All the pain  
I thought I knew  
All these thoughts lead back to you  
Back to what  
  
Was never said  
Back and forth  
Inside my head  
I can't handle this confusion  
  
I'm unable  
Come and take me away  
  
I feel  
Like I  
Am alone  
All by  
  
Myself  
I need to get around this  
My words  
Are cold  
  
I don't want them to hurt you  
If I  
Show you  
I don't think you'd understand  
'Cause no one understands  
  
All the pain  
I thought I knew  
All these thoughts lead back to you  
Back to what  
  
Was never said  
Back and forth  
Inside my head  
I can't handle this confusion  
  
I'm unable  
Come and take me away  
  
I'm going nowhere  
On and on and  
I'm getting nowhere  
On and on and  
Take me away  
  
I'm going nowhere  
On and on and  
Up and on and  
Up and on  
  
All the pain  
I thought I knew  
All these thoughts lead back to you  
Back to what  
  
Was never said  
Back and forth  
Inside my head  
I can't handle this confusion  
  
I'm unable  
Come and take me away  
  
Take me away  
Break me away  
Take me away


Don't say no to anything,  
Yes, yes, say yes to everything,  
Just find away, to get away (wanna run away?)  
Let's take off our clothes, and see if anybody notices  
Then run away, what d'you say?  
Have a little joy have a little faith, live life  
Have a little hope have a lot of fun  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause you, you, you never know what fate will throw,  
To make you stop,  
I, I, I'm gonna try  
To let this life  
Pick me up and take me away  
  
Run up to a stranger,  
Kiss and tell them that you love them,  
And then walk away,  
You made their day (at least you hope you did)  
Stand up in a restaurant,  
Start dancing on the table,  
Get kicked out for that behavior (oops I did it again)  
Have a little joy have a little faith, live life  
Have a little hope have a lot of fun  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Don't you know that nothing equals nothing,  
Do anything, do everything, do something  
Open up your mouth and let your soul sing  
  
You, you, you never know what faith will throw,  
To make you stop  
  
[Guitar solo]  
  
You, you, you never know what fate will throw,  
To make you stop  
I'm gonna try,  
To let this life,  
Pick me up and take me away


Let me hear you say: "hey, hey, hey" (Hey, hey, hey)  
All right, now let me hear you say: "hey, hey, ho" (Hey, hey, hey)  
  
I hate it when a guy doesn't get the door  
Even though I told him yesterday and the day before  
I hate it when a guy doesn't get the tab  
And I have to pull my money out, and that looks bad  
  
Where are the hopes, where are the dreams  
My Cinderella story scene?  
When do you think they'll finally see  
  
That you're not, not, not gonna get any better  
You won't, won't, won't, you won't get rid of me never  
Like it or not, even though she's a lot like me  
We're not the same  
  
[Chorus]  
And, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm a lot to handle  
You don't know trouble, I'm a hell of a scandal  
Me, I'm a scene, I'm a drama queen  
I'm the best damn thing that your eyes have ever seen  
  
All right, all right  
Yeah  
  
I hate it when a guy doesn't understand  
Why a certain time of month I don't want to hold his hand  
I hate it when they go out, and we stay in  
And they come home smelling like their ex-girlfriend  
  
But I found my hopes, I found my dreams  
My Cinderella story scene  
Now everybody's gonna see  
  
That you're not, not, not gonna get any better  
You won't, won't, won't, you won't get rid of me never  
Like it or not, even though she's a lot like me  
We're not the same  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Give me an A, always give me what I want  
Give me a V, be very, very good to me  
R, are you gonna treat me right?  
I, I can put up a fight  
Give me an L, let me hear you scream loud (let me hear you scream loud)  
  
One, two, three, four  
  
Where are the hopes, where are the dreams  
My Cinderella story scene?  
When do you think they'll finally see  
  
That you're not, not, not gonna get any better  
You won't, won't, won't, you won't get rid of me never  
Like it or not, even though she's a lot like me  
We're not the same  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let me hear you say: "hey, hey, hey" (Hey, hey, hey)  
All right, now let me hear you say: "hey, hey, hey" (Hey, hey, hey)  
  
(Hey, hey, hey)  
(Hey, hey, hey)  
(Hey, hey, hey)  
(Hey, hey, hey)  
  
I'm the best damn thing that your eyes have ever seen


Hello out there, were on the air  
It's hockey night tonight!  
Tension grows,  
As the whistle blows,  
And the puck goes down the ice.  
The goalie jumps,  
And the players bump,  
And the fans all go insane.  
Someone roars:  
"Bobby Scores!"  
At the good old hockey game!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh!  
The good old hockey game!  
It's the best game you can name!  
And the best game you can name,  
Is the good old hockey game!  
  
Second Period.  
Players dash,  
With skates a-flash,  
The home team trails behind.  
But they grab the puck,  
And go bursting up,  
And they're down across the line.  
They storm the crease,  
Like bumblebees,  
They travel like a burning flame.  
See them slide the puck inside,  
It's a one one hockey game!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh!  
The good old hockey game!  
It's the best game you can name!  
And the best game you can name,  
Is the good old hockey game!  
  
Third Period.  
Last game in the play-offs too.  
Oh take me where, the hockey players,  
Face off down the rink,  
And the Stanley Cup,  
Is all filled up,  
For the champs who win the drink!  
Now the final flick,  
Of a hockey stick,  
And a one gigantic scream:  
"THE PUCK IS IN! THE HOME TEAM WINS!"  
At the good old hockey game  
  
(chorus- repeat 3 times)  
Oh!  
The good old hockey game!  
It's the best game you can name!  
And the best game you can name,  
Is the good old hockey game!


[Verse:]  
I know I'll never have him  
But I'm there when you're not over his friend  
I listen when you come to me  
But 'cause of who he is you don't have the time to see  
  
I really feel the way you feel  
Just 'cause it's him don't mean it's not real  
Your always sayin' your love's true  
I listen but I can't say the same for you  
  
[Bridge:]  
What I offer's unreturned  
You don't have time to see me burn  
You've so far failed to see  
How much you're affecting me  
  
[Chorus:]  
When you think of him  
I'm thinkin' of the other guy  
I'm in love to  
He's constantly on my mind  
If you weren't shared by blood  
Then would you have the time  
I don't get to choose  
Who I dream of at night  
You tell me how you feel  
I feel the same way with the other guy  
So bad it's not real  
You can't make me cover it up, you know I really try  
You can see by my skin  
I shiver and shake and I follow him with my eyes  
I'm nervous and I know it's a sin  
But seein' him drives me wild inside  
  
[Verse 3:]  
If it was another  
Maybe not your brother  
Would it be ok to let him drive me wild?  
But then lookin' back  
You've always turned your back  
Would it be ok to listen to my smile?  
  
[Verse 4]  
Your convinced  
He's so unperfect  
But I'm convinced  
That it's worth it  
  
I listen to you goin on and on  
Bout how you and that boy got it on  
You don't have time to listen to me  
I'm in love but you can't see  
I don't have opinions you just talk  
But with me you tell me I'm stupid to feel what I feel  
I can't run away you only let me walk  
Come on now girl, you ain't bein' real


Hanging out behind the club on the weekends  
Acting stupid, getting drunk with my best friends  
I couldn't wait for the summer and the Warped Tour  
I remember that it's the first time that I saw her there  
  
She's getting kicked out of school cause she's failing  
I'm kinda nervous, cause I think all her friends hate me  
She's the one, she'll always be there  
She took my hand and I made it I swear  
  
Chorus  
  
Because I fell in love with the girl at the rock show  
She said "what?" and I told her that I didn't know  
She's so cool, better sneak me through her window  
Everything's better when she's around  
I Can't wait until her parents go out of town  
Cause I fell in love with the girl at the rock show  
  
When we said we were gonna move to Las Vegas  
I remember the look her mother gave us  
17 without a purpose or direction  
We don't owe anyone a fuckin explanation  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Black and white picture of her on my wall  
I waited for her call, she always kept me waiting  
And if I ever got another chance I'd still ask her to dance  
Because she kept me waiting  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
With the girl at the rock show  
With the girl at the rock show  
(I'll never forget tonight)  
With the girl at the punk show......


Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry  
You don't know how lovely you are  
I had to find you, tell you I need you  
Tell you I set you apart  
  
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions  
Oh, let's go back to the start  
Running in circles, coming up tails  
Heads on a science apart  
  
Nobody said it was easy  
It's such a shame for us to part  
Nobody said it was easy  
No one ever said it would be this hard  
Oh, take me back to the start  
  
I was just guessing at numbers and figures  
Pulling the puzzles apart  
Questions of science, science and progress  
Do not speak as loud as my heart  
  
But tell me you love me, come back and haunt me  
Oh and I rush to the start  
Running in circles, chasing our tails  
Coming back as we are  
  
Nobody said it was easy  
Oh, it's such a shame for us to part  
Nobody said it was easy  
No one ever said it would be so hard  
I'm going back to the start  
  
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Ah ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh  
Oh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh


Are you ready kids?  
I said, "Are you ready?"  
  
Who lives in a pineapple under the sea  
SpongeBob SquarePants  
Absorbent and yellow and porous is he

If nautical nonsense be something you wish  
SpongeBob SquarePants  
Then drop on the deck and flop like a fish

It's a forgone conclusion, you're love's an illusion  
And the picture is starting to fade  
Boy let's be honest, when it comes to your promise  
It's just a lot of empty words you say  
And the future's only gonna be more of the same  
You've only got yourself to blame  
  
[Chorus:]  
Tomorrow you didn't, yesterday you won't  
'Cause I know everything you say you gonna do you don't  
That's a given, it doesn't matter anyway  
Hey, I know what love wasn't, I know what love isn't  
So when you say you're gonna change you gotta be kidding  
Tomorrow you didn't,  
Hey hey, I'm outta here today  
  
I used to believe in, all your romantic dreaming  
But it really ain't that cute anymore  
'Cause my time's to precious  
So I wish you the best with  
Whatever it is you're looking for  
Baby this is all for your own good,  
I'm leaving 'cause I know you never would  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I don't need a crystalball to see it all my dear,  
It doesn't matter what you say,  
It always turns out the same way  
Your predictions are fiction  
And it's tragically clear  
  
[Guitar solo]  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
(Dadada, Yea)


It's the first time I ever felt this lonely  
I wish someone could cure this pain  
It's funny when you think its gonna work out  
'Til you chose weed over me, you're so lame  
  
I thought you were cool until the point  
But up until the point you didn't call me  
When you said you would  
I finally figured out you're all the same  
Always coming up with some kind of story  
  
Every time I try to make you smile  
You're always feeling sorry for yourself  
Every time I try to make you laugh  
You can't  
You're too tough  
You think you're loveless  
Is that too much that I'm asking for?  
  
I thought you'd come around when I ignored you  
So I thought you'd have the decency to change  
But babe, I guess you didn't take that warning  
'Cause I'm not about to look at your face again  
  
Can't you see that you lie to yourself  
You can't see the world through a mirror  
It won't be too late when the smoke clears  
'Cause I, I am still here  
  
But every time I try to make you smile  
You'd always grow up feeling sorry for yourself  
Every time I try to make you laugh  
You stand like a stone  
Alone in your zone  
Is it too much that I'm asking for?  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Can't find where I am  
Lying here  
Alone I fear  
Afraid of the dark  
No one to claim  
Alone again  
  
Can't you see that you lie to yourself  
You can't see the world through a mirror  
It won't be too late when the smoke clears  
'Cause I, I am still here  
  
Every time I try to make you smile  
You're always feeling sorry for yourself  
Every time I try to make you laugh  
You can't  
You're too tough  
You think you're loveless  
It was too much that I asked you for


Used to carry this big old world  
On my shoulders and back  
I used to lie inside my room  
Wondering where I am at  
  
I felt a chill running through my veins  
And wondered, would I be saved?  
I felt the ice building in my soul  
Would it melt away?  
  
He's a warm breeze  
Breathing life into me  
He's the sunlight  
Shining down on me  
  
I used to worry my life away  
Counting every dime  
Shutting out the ones I loved  
Never finding the time  
  
And then one day I was overcome  
By loneliness and despair  
And deep inside I thought I heard  
"Lean on me, I'm here"  
  
He's a warm breeze  
Breathing life into me  
He's the sunlight  
Shining down on me  
I pulled the burden from off my back  
And tossed it into the wind  
And stretched my arms toward the sky  
And let my life begin  
  
And like a tree, I have measured up  
Best when I've been cut down  
And like a tree, I can touch the sky  
With my feet on the ground  
  
He's a warm breeze  
Breathing life into me  
He's the sunlight  
Shining down on me  
  
He's a warm breeze  
Breathing life into me  
He's the sunlight  
Shining down on me, yeah  
Shining down on me  
Shining down, shining down  
Shining down on me


There's this one guy  
There's no one like him in all the world  
'Cause you can always see  
Those girls down on there knees  
  
In those dark sweaty rooms  
Planning out his thoughts  
He's waiting for just the right  
  
One by one as they  
Walk right through the door, they  
Keep on coming back  
Guess they just want more  
  
He has fun fun fun and you  
Might call him a whore, but  
Just look where he's at 'cause  
He is the one that scores  
  
I saw my friend there  
Out on the field today  
I asked him where he's going, he said  
"All the way," now  
  
One by one as they  
Walk right through the door, they  
Keep on coming back  
Guess they just want more  
  
He has fun fun fun and you  
Might call him a whore, but  
Just look where he's at 'cause  
He is the one that scores  
  
Go!

Chorus: Trust Me, Life Gets Hard Be Inside Live Your Life Feel The World Do

Am I dreaming?  
Or Stupid?  
I think I've been hit by cupid  
No one needs to know  
Right now.  
  
You are viewing lyrics of No One Needs To Know by avril lavigne from the album
unknown at Lyricsandsongs. Com  
  
I met a tall, dark and handsome man  
And I've been busy making big plans  
No one needs to know  
Right now.  
I got my heart set  
My feet wet  
But he don't even know it yet  
No one needs to know  
Right now.  
  
I'll tell him someday, someway, somehow  
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now  
  
I want bells to ring  
The choir to sing  
A white dress that gets to keep the kinda hold on thing  
But no one needs to know  
Right now.  
  
I'll tell him, someday, someway, someway  
But I'm gonna keep it a secret for now.  
  
Gonna have a little girl  
A little boy  
A little engy we call Leroy  
But no one needs to know  
Right now.  
  
And I'm not lo-ohnly anymore at night  
And he don't kno-oh-only he can make it right  
And I'm not lo-ohnly anymore at night  
And he don't kno-oh-only he can make it right  
  
Am I dreaming?  
Or Stupid?  
But boy have I been hit by cupid.  
No one needs to know  
Right now.  
No one needs to know  
Right now  
No one needs to know right now


All that I did was walk over  
Start off by shaking your hands  
That's how it went  
I had a smile on my face and I sat up straight  
Oh, yeah, yeah  
I wanted to know you  
I wanted to show you  
  
[Chorus]  
You don't know me  
Don't ignore me  
You don't want me there  
You just shut me out  
You don't know me  
Don't ignore me  
If you had your way  
You'd just shut me up  
Make me go away  
  
No, I just don't understand why  
You won't talk to me  
It's hurts that I'm so unwanted for nothing  
Don't talk words against me  
I wanted to know you  
I wanted to show you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Make me go away  
  
I tried to belong  
It didn't seem wrong  
My head aches  
Its been so long  
I'll write this song  
If that's what it take  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Make me go away  
Make me go away


Watching your house shrink away in my rear-view mirror  
As I drive away  
Wishing that I could take back all those words  
That meant nothing that I didn't say  
  
I'm trying  
To be what you want me to be  
But it's so damn hard to keep playing the part  
Of the fool, week after week  
  
I think you need some time alone (I think you need some time alone)  
You say you want someone to call your own  
Open your eyes, you can suck in your pride  
You can live your life all on your own  
  
Is this all going to be just another time  
That we play this game?  
I've tried to convince you that things could be different  
But somehow they end up the same  
  
But what  
Did you expect from me? What am I supposed to do?  
You say that you're starting to feel like you're getting lost  
Well, I do, too  
  
I don't wanna live this lie again (I don't wanna live this lie again)  
I know I'll get it right but I don't know when  
I'll open my eyes, I've got something in side  
I'll just jack off in my room until then  
  
It's never over 'til it's done  
And I don't think that you're the one  
It's never over 'til it's done  
And I don't think that you're the one


Time is valuable  
Mine is useless  
Next to you i feel nothing  
Nothing makes me fear  
Im me and im strong  
I've a hard heart  
It naver breaks  
  
So,its waste of time attacking to me  
Ill never fall I'll never die  
I ask you if you love me  
And you always lie and lie  
  
Crime is so bad  
You are so mad  
You try to make me  
Exact like you baby  
You will naver do it  
You are fragile  
You will be broken


You say that I'm messing with your head  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
All cause I was making out with your friend  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Love hurts whether it's right or wrong  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I can't stop cause I'm having too much fun  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
You're on your knees  
Begging please  
Stay with me  
But honestly  
I just need to be a little crazy  
  
All my life I've been good,  
But now whoa, I'm thinking what the hell  
All I want is to mess around  
And I don't really care about  
If you love me  
If you hate me  
You can't save me  
Baby, baby  
All my life I've been good  
But now  
Whoa  
What the hell  
  
So what if I go out on a million dates  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
You never call or listen to me anyway  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I'd rather rage than sit around and wait all day  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Don't get me wrong  
I just need some time to play  
  
You're on your knees  
Begging please  
Stay with me  
But honestly  
I just need to be a little crazy  
  
All my life I've been good,  
But now  
I'm thinking what the hell  
All I want is to mess around  
And I don't really care about  
  
If you love me  
If you hate me  
You can't save me  
Baby, baby  
All my life I've been good  
But now  
Whoa  
What the hell  
  
La la la la la la la la  
Whoa whoa

Whoa whoa  
  
You say that I'm messing with your head  
Boy, I like messing in your bed  
Yeah, I am messing with your head when  
I'm messing with you in bed  
  
All my life I've been good,  
But now oh  
I'm thinking what the hell  
All I want is to mess around  
And I don't really care about  
All my life I've been good,  
But now oh  
I'm thinking what the hell  
All I want is to mess around  
And I don't really care about  
If you love me  
If you hate me  
You can't save me  
Baby, baby  
All my life I've been good  
But now  
Whoa  
What the hell  
  
La la la la la  
La la la la la  
La la la la la

Why, do you always do this to me?  
Why, couldn't you just see through me?  
How come, you act like this  
Like you just don't care at all  
  
Do you expect me to believe I was the only one to fall?  
I could feel I could feel you near me, even though you're far away  
I could feel I could feel you baby, why  
  
It's not supposed to feel this way  
I need you, I need you  
More and more each day  
It's not supposed to hurt this way  
I need you, I need you, I need you  
Tell me, are you and me still together?  
Tell me, do you think we could last forever?  
Tell me, why  
  
Hey, listen to what we're not saying  
Let's play, a different game than what we're playing  
Try, to look at me and really see my heart  
  
Do you expect me to believe I'm gonna let us fall apart?  
I could feel I could feel you near me, even when you're far away  
I could feel I could feel you baby, why  
  
It's not supposed to feel this way  
I need you, I need you  
More and more each day  
It's not supposed to hurt this way  
I need you, I need you, I need you  
Tell me, are you and me still together?  
Tell me, you think we could last forever?  
Tell me, why  
  
So go and think about whatever you need to think about  
Go ahead and dream about whatever you need to dream about  
And come back to me when you know just how you feel, you feel  
I could feel I could feel you near me, even though you're far away  
I could feel I could feel you baby, why  
  
It's not supposed to hurt this way  
I need you, I need you  
More and more each day  
It's not supposed to hurt this way  
I need you, I need you, I need you  
Tell me  
  
It's not supposed to hurt this way  
I need you, I need you  
More and more each day  
It's not supposed to hurt this way  
I need you, I need you, I need you  
Tell me, are you and me still together?  
Tell me, do you think we could last forever?  
Tell me, why


First glance, you nearly made my jaw drop  
First dance, and you were looking so hot  
How tense, I moved in for a lip-lock  
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby  
  
A first taste like honey, you were so yum  
Can't wait for a second 'cause it's so fun  
Third base, I'm headed for a homerun  
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby now  
  
Hold on tight to this rollercoaster ride  
And if you're loving this  
Just give me one more kiss  
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet  
  
Just let go, if you don't, we'll never know  
So if you're loving this  
Just give me one more kiss  
'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet  
  
My place, you showed up with flowers  
Your face, could stare at it for hours  
Can't wait to see your superpowers  
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby  
  
Your car, I'm sitting right beside you  
Rockstar at everything that you do  
My heart is ready for the next move  
Don't stop baby, don't stop baby now  
  
Hold on tight to this rollercoaster ride

Excuse me sir, do I have your attention,  
There's something if you don't mind I'd like to mention,  
So open those ears, sit your butt down and shut your mouth up  
I'm aware that it's hard for you to do that,  
All I ask is lay down, put your feet up  
Now soak in, pay attention, learn a lesson loud and clear  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hey, you're a dirty liar,  
You wronged me out for something I thought was right,  
I wanted to be left alone,  
Not shown around like your golden prize  
Oh, I looked around,  
Look what happened, you found out  
You never satisfy me  
  
Never trusted anyone in the first place,  
You turned me up, your disgusting anyway  
Hear that music, crank it up,  
Is there something familiar in the singer's voice  
Turn it down, now listen to me,  
What made you think you were my authority  
I'm awake, finally now I'm able to move on (just gotta tell the truth)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Now do these words stick to you, hope they do  
Think about it, think about it  
Stick to you like superglue, keep you from the things you do  
  
[Guitar solo]  
  
[Chorus 2x]


Once we were lovers just lovers we were  
Oh, what a life  
Once we were dreamers just dreamers we were  
Oh, you and I  
Now I see you're just somebody who wastes all my time and money  
What a lie, you and I  
  
[Chorus]  
What about your  
Your 10,000 promises?  
That you gave to me  
Your 10,000 promises  
That you promised me  
  
Once I could handle the truth  
When the truth was you and I  
But time after time all the  
Promises turned out to be all lies  
Now I see I'm just somebody who wasted my time and money  
What a lie (what a lie, what a lie, oh)  
You and I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You said "I'll take you back"  
But I closed the door 'cause I don't want  
10,000 more  
Oh  
  
10,000 promises yeah (oh)  
10,000 promises you gave to me  
  
Repeat chorus  
What about your 10,000 promises?  
You gave to me (That you gave to me)  
What about your 10,000 promises?  
You gave to me  
Once we were lovers just lovers we were  
Oh you and I  
What a lie


I don't know what he does to make you cry,  
But I'll be there to make you smile.  
I don't have a fancy car,  
To get to you I'd walk a thousand miles.  
I don't care if he buys you nice things  
Does his gifts come from the heart, I don't know  
But if you were my girl  
I'd make it so we'd never be apart.  
  
But my love is all I have to give  
Without you I don't think I can live  
I wish I could give the world to you, but  
Love is all I have to give  
  
When you talk-does it seem like he's not  
Even listening to a word you say?  
That's okay babe, just tell me your problems  
I'll try my best to kiss them all away  
Does he leave when you need him the most?  
Does his friends get all your time?  
Baby please, I'm on my knees  
Praying for the day that you'll be mine!!  
  
To you, hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more-inside  
All the money in the world could never add up to all the love  
I have inside, I Love You  
  
And I will give it to you  
All I can give, all I can give  
Everything I have is for you  
But love is all I have to give


I don't know what he does to make you cry

Hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more inside, oh  
All the money in the world could never add up to  
All the love I have inside, I love you, baby  
And I will give it to you  
All I can give, all I can give

Without you I don't think I could live  
I wish I could give the world to you  
But love is all I have to give to you  


All In This Together  
  
Let me tell you what I see through my eyes  
Apathy is all around and on the rise  
We channel so much energy through our greed  
Which leads us to become absolved of those in need  
Lemme tell you  
  
Money can't buy lives  
Sunny days for you  
Living is more than profits accrued  
We need to love and be loved  
And brought in the things we are thankful of  
Remember your brothers and sisters  
Because we are all in this together  
  
It's funny how we took a prayer out of schools  
After the 9-11 scare that's all we do  
We compromise our liberties for security  
We can become so self in dosed that we can't see  
Lemme tell you  
  
Money can't buy lives  
Sunny days for you  
Living is more than profits accrued  
We need to love and be loved  
And brought in the things we are thankful of  
Remember your brothers and sisters  
Because we are all in this together  
  
Don't throw in the towel  
Let's overcome the test for now  
Together (together) we last, divided we fall  
Love will conquer all  
  
Money can't buy lives  
Sunny days for you (Sunny days for you)  
Living is more than profits accrued  
(We gotta change, we gotta change right now)  
We need to love and be loved  
And brought in the things we are thankful of  
Remember your brothers and sisters  
Because we are all in this together  
  
Money can't buy lives  
Sunny days for you  
Living is more than profits accrued  
We need to love and be loved  
And brought in the things we are thankful of  
Remember your brothers and sisters  
Because we are all in this together


I'd go anywhere for you  
Anywhere you asked me to  
I'd do anything for you  
Anything you want me to  
  
I'd walk halfway around the world  
For just one kiss from you  
Far beyond the call of love  
The sun, the stars, the moon  
As long as your love's there to lead me  
I won't lose my way believe me  
Even through the darkest night you know  
  
[Chorus]  
I'd go anywhere for you  
Anywhere you asked me to  
I'd do anything for you  
Anything you want me to  
Your love as far as I can see  
Is all I'm ever gonna need  
There's one thing for sure  
I know it's true  
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you  
  
I used to think that dreams were just  
For sentimental fools  
And I'd never find someone  
Who'd give their love so true  
But I knew the very minute  
Couldn't live my life without you in it  
And now I want the whole world  
To know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, oh [Repeat: x3]  
  
[Chorus: x2]


There's a spark of magic in your eyes  
And Candyland appears each time you smile  
Never thought that fairytales came true  
But they come true, when I'm near you  
Your a genie in disguise  
Full of wonder and surprise  
  
And, Betcha by golly Wow!  
Your the one that I've been waiting for forever  
Forever will my love for you keep growing strong  
Keep growing strong  
  
Ladies, sometimes a man can't find the words  
To express all he feels inside  
But ever just so often  
The words of another, who's truly in love  
Seem to work our just fine  
  
To say I love you  
To say.....  
I love you  
  
Keep growing strong  
Keep growing strong


As I was walking down a  
Path in the woods one day I  
Came across a vision that caught my eye  
  
There was a lady standing  
Right there beside a well, and I heard her whisper  
What you wish for you can have  
  
Then the vision went away  
I thought that I had lost her  
The girl I had been waiting for  
I can't believe I just saw her  
She is the finest thing, I ever could imagine  
Now I want her next to me, cause I want, cause I want more  
Whoahhhh  
  
Chorus  
Come to me my Cinderella  
Straight to my wishing well and  
You're the one I'll always cherish  
I ya ya ya ya ya  
Come to me my Cinderella  
Straight to my wishing well and  
You're the one I'll love forever  
I ya ya ya ya ya  
  
She is a gentle flower, she is the sun and rain and  
She could be the reason for my joy and my pain  
The first thing I see each morning, the last thing I see at night  
You know if I could have all that  
That's all I wish for in my life  
  
Why did she have to go  
What do I say to find her  
This girl is the only one  
I cannot deny her  
She's making love to my mind  
And I can't forget this feeling  
It's her voice that's calling  
It's her voice I need  
Whoahhh  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Ohhh Cinderella  
Ohhh Cinderella  
Ohhh Cinderella  
You're all that I want  
You're all that I need  
Come back to me now  
Cinderella  
  
(Chorus Fade)


Don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
So don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
  
I woke up this mornin'  
From a dream  
That you were saying goodbye  
We had a simple argument  
But not enough to keep out  
Each other's life  
  
I want to be happy  
But I can't be happy  
If I can't be with you  
'Cause you're my baby  
My sweet honey  
And no other girl will do  
  
Don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
So don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
  
I can't seem to figure out  
Just what went wrong with us  
You must've thought I was selfish  
But everything I did I did for us  
  
I want to be happy  
But I can't be happy  
If I can't be with you  
'Cause you're my baby  
My sweet honey  
And no other girl will do  
  
Don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
So don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
  
I can't eat or even sleep  
Till I have you  
Back inside my world  
My life won't be complete  
Unless you stay my girl  
  
Don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
So don't leave me 'cause you need me  
I never want to be without you  
  
Come on girl let me break it down  
  
Don't leave me girl  
Don't leave me  
Don't go  
Don't go  
  
Don't leave me (I don't want to let you go)  
'Cause you need me (I don't want to be alone)  
I never want to be without you (I never want to be alone)  
Don't leave me (Oh baby I need to be)  
'Cause you need me (In your life)  
I never want to be without you (Girl, I'll never let you go)  
  
Don't leave me girl  
Don't leave me  
Don't go  
Don't go


[Chorus]  
Everybody  
Rock your body  
Everybody  
Rock your body right

[Chorus: x2]


Listen girl, I don't know where to start  
Cause every word I say is straight from the heart  
I've been so wrong, I've never meant to hurt you  
Oh girl, I'm sorry of what I put you through  
Girl I'd do anything for one more chance,  
Cause I want you back again  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause every time I close my eyes,I see your face and I wonder  
When you close your eyes do you think about me?  
Now I realize and I want you girl and no other  
And every time I close my eyes  
You're all that I see.  
  
You and I we shared enough together  
Each other was all we'd ever need  
I thought that you would stay with me forever  
But I took for granted the love you gave to me  
But I'll keep on trying, till the end  
Baby I need you back with me  
I need you back,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And girl I'm going out of my mind  
I miss ya so much, I don't know what to do  
Please say its just a matter of time,  
Until I feel your touch,  
Until you let me come back to you  
  
I think about you girl every time at night  
I'm in love, and it feels so right  
I never meant to hurt you or cause you pain  
I was just caught up in the lying game  
But now those days are over, I've changed my ways  
Now I'm counting the minutes, I'm counting the days  
Until you let me come back,  
Until you let me start  
To find a new way to get back into your heart.  
  
[Chorus]


Oh oh oh oh,  
Oh oh oh oh,  
Oh,  
Yeah,  
  
You had me waitin even on the second date,  
I picked you up I took you to your favourite place,  
I saw you flirtin but I looked the other way,  
Away, away, away, hey,  
  
You pulled me up and said you had a place to go,  
Just grabbed my keys, you took my car and stole my phone,  
I know I shouldn't but I let you get away,  
Away, away, away,  
  
But I'm not a player,  
I'm not a clown,  
I wont be a puppet,  
Just hangin around,  
You need another man to put diamonds on your hands,  
And let you take his car,  
I found out who you are,  
I finally figured you out,  
  
Oh no,  
I shouldve seen it comin you were just pretend,  
You just took my credit card and maxed it til the end,  
I wish I'd known before I hit the atm,  
Oh no,  
It happened again,  
(Oh yeah)  
  
I'm not a player,  
I'm not a clown,  
I wont be a puppet,  
Just hangin around,  
You need another man to put diamonds on your hands,  
And let you take his car,  
I found out who you are,  
I finally figured (I figured you out),  
I finally figured (oh figured you out),  
I finally figured (oh yeah) you out,  
  
I'm goin away (far, far away),  
I'm goin away (so far away),  
I'm goin away (far, far away),  
I'm gonna pack your bags and kick you out,  
I'm sorry but I figured you out,  
(Figured you out, yeah),  
So long, so long,  
Farewell,  
  
(Cause) I'm not a player,  
I'm not a clown,  
(I wont be) I wont be a puppet,  
Just hangin around,  
You need another man (diamonds on your hands) to put diamonds on your hands,  
And let you take his car,

Backstreet  
Check it uh  
Hey  
  
Let's talk about one, baby  
You gotta hear me out  
Did you really think I'd be the last to know  
What it's all about  
  
Let's talk about you  
You say  
He's the essence of your life  
But he'll eat you up from inside slow  
And then he doesn't want to know  
  
I'm tellin' you he'll eat you up from inside  
And then he doesn't want to know  
  
[Chorus]  
Listen I mean it  
There's nothin' that he's worthy of  
He's just another player  
Playing in the name of love  
I've seen enough  
Now this must come to an end  
Get another boyfriend  
  
Let's talk about what he's done (he's done)  
To become your number one  
Or was it all the promises of diamonds, pearls and party dresses  
That turn you on  
I've seen it before (dont take!)  
Anymore, free too  
You're through for sure  
Just go get on with your life  
Stop acting like you've given up  
I'm tellin' you to go get on with your life  
Stop acting like you've given up  
  
Listen I mean it (I mean it)  
There's nothin' that he's worthy of  
He's just another player (player)  
Playing in the name of love  
I've seen enough  
Now this must come to an end (must come to an end)  
Get another boyfriend  
  
All right  
Yeah  
Get another boyfriend  
Stop  
Hey  
  
Hear me out  
You must know (you must know)  
What it's all about (baby)  
That he's just a player in love (love)  
This must come to an end  
Get another boyfriend  
  
[Chorus: x2]


It's in the silences, the words you never say  
I see it in your eyes, always starts the same way  
It seems like everyone we know is breaking up  
Does anybody ever stay in love, anymore?  
I promise you from the bottom of my heart  
I will love you till death do us part  
I promise you as a lover and a friend  
I will love you like I never love again  
With everything I am  
I see you look at me when you think I'm not aware  
You're searching for clues of just how deep my feelings are  
How do you prove the sky is blue, the oceans wide?  
All I know is what I feel when I look into your eyes  
I promise you from the bottom of my heart  
I will love you till death do us part  
I promise you as a lover and a friend  
I will love you like I never love again  
With everything that I am  
Oh, there are no guarantees  
That's what you always say to me  
But late at night I feel the tremble in your touch  
But what I'm trying to say to you  
I've never said to anyone  
I promise you from the bottom of my heart  
I will love you till death do us part  
I promise you as a lover and a friend  
I will love you like I never love again  
With everything I am  
I promise you from the bottom of my heart  
I will love you till death do us part  
I promise you as a lover and a friend  
I will love you like I never love again  
With everything I am  
You're everything I am  
With everything I am  


The very first time  
That I saw your brown eyes  
Your lips said hello and I said hi  
I knew right then you were the one  
But I was caught up  
In physical attraction  
But to my satisfaction  
Baby you were more than just a face  
  
And if I ever (ever fall) in love again (again)  
I will be sure that the lady is a friend  
And if I ever (ever fall) in love so true (true)  
I will be sure that the ladys just like you  
  
Oh, yeah, the very next time shell be my friend  
  
If I say that I will be your one and only  
(promise, promise) promise that you'll never leave me lonely  
I just wanna be the one you need  
Oh, baby  
I just wanna be the one who serves you  
Sometime I feel as if I don't deserve you  
I cherish every moment that we share  
  
And if I ever (ever fall) in love again (again)  
I will be sure that the lady is a friend  
And if I ever (ever fall) in love so true (true)

Wide open, now I'm yours  
You found me heartbroken  
Heartbroken, on the floor  
Became my salvation  
Salvation through the war, yeah  
You got me wide open  
Wide open, now I'm sure  
  
In a world like this where some back down

Away  
Internationally  
Away  
  
Chorus:  
Away  
I just wanna take you everywhere that I go  
Girl I want you in a plane in a seat right next to mine  
Get witchu right after my shows  
Baby I could give you ways  
Come on girl, lets fly  
Away  
Internationally  
  
Now I don't usually meet under these circumstances, but...  
You're like the perfect girl with the perfect skin, so...  
I'm just too scared to know that I'm gonna leave without you girl [?]  
  
You can call me a man  
  
Bridge 1:  
Because I know  
That this aint the kind of love that could just take  
One night and then it's over  
Girl I know  
I aint never fell in love so quickly  
Baby please come with me  
All you need is my love in a bag  
  
Chorus  
  
Girl I can think of only one and no one else and dance to you  
Were like the perfect team  
No matter where I go you gotta roll  
I bet they know about you and I'm not leaving without you girl [?]  
  
And I don't need to read your mind  
  
Bridge 2:  
Because I know  
That you want to see the world  
And I could say that all I need is  
One night and then well be closer  
And I know  
I aint never fell in love so quickly  
Baby please come with me  
All you need is my love in a bag


Looking at your picture from when we first met  
You gave me a smile that I could never forget  
And nothing I could do could protect me from you that night  
  
Wrapped around your finger, always on my mind  
The days would blend 'cause we stayed up all night  
Yeah, you and I were everything, everything to me  
  
[Chorus]  
I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go  
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end  
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me  
But still I have to say I would do it all again  
Just want you to know  
  
All the doors are closing I'm tryin' to move ahead  
And deep inside I wish it's me instead  
My dreams are empty from the day, the day you slipped away  
  
I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go  
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end  
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me  
But still I have to say I would do it all again  
Just want you to know  
  
That since I lost you, I lost myself  
No I can't fake it, there's no one else  
  
[Chorus: x2]


Something about the way you moved  
That caught my eye  
I really did have to try it  
I can't deny it  
The way your body swings  
As I watched you from behind  
That got me so excited  
How could I fly in  
Baby let me be the on to hold you  
To give you the things I know you need  
You know that we can wait another life time  
And we can never find a love just like this  
  
[Chorus]  
If you lay down lay down beside me  
You can get on inside me  
And I can get on inside you too  
If you lay down lay down beside me  
You can wake up beside me, forever  
Forever and ever  
Forever and ever, baby  
  
Let's take this chance to get to know each other better  
Baby we will discover that we can be more than lovers  
I give you what you need  
Just come to me and get it  
Baby you won't regret it  
  
No, no, no baby  
Baby move a little closer, yeah  
I want to feel your body next to mine  
And before this night is over  
You will know what I need  
Talking love in your sleep  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tonight, (tonight) we'll find  
Just what what we've been looking for  
Good, good lovin' and a whole lot more  
Hold on  
Be inside  
Hold me and don't you let go  
Until I tell you to  
  
[Chorus]


I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never  
Let's make a toast to our love  
I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never  
Let's make a toast to our love  
  
Here's to us, girl, you and I  
May our love last 'til eternity  
The love we have can touch the sky  
It's just enough love for you and me  
  
Now we've been blessed (we've been blessed)  
With happiness (with happiness)  
Your love came from up above  
So we'll always stay together  
We must keep that forever  
  
I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never (oh girl)  
Let's make a toast to our love  
I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never (oh girl)  
Let's make a toast to our love  
  
We sip the champagne as a symbol of love  
We want everyone to know just how much  
Made a vow, to one another  
You'll always be my lady, and I'll always be your man  
As we sit at the table, reserved for two  
All this love, girl, and it's only me and you  
It's so amazing another can rely  
Stars fill the sky, the night is so right  
  
We've been blessed (we've been blessed)  
With happiness (with happiness)  
Your love came from up above  
So we'll always stay together  
We must keep that forever  
  
I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never (oh girl)  
Let's make a toast to our love  
I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never (oh girl)  
Let's make a toast to our love  
  
I'll love you forever  
Leaving you, I'll never  
Let's make a toast to our love


Liftin' me up, me up, me up, me up. Liftin' me up, me up, me up, me up...  
  
When I'm down on my luck and I'm searching for my soul  
When I'm feeling too much and I start to lose control  
When I'm down so low that even enemies don't wanna know  
You still care for me, say a prayer for me, and I know  
  
Oooh, I like you hangin' around  
'Cause you lift me up when I am upside down  
Oooh, you are my favorite sound  
'Cause you're always down for  
  
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
When your arms are around me  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
When I'm lost along the way and I can't face another day  
And if I stumble on the road and if I can't carry the load  
And if I lose my faith, and kindness, and generosity  
Would you hold my hand?  
Say you understand my pain  
  
Oooh, I like you hangin' around  
'Cause you lift me up when I am upside down  
Oooh, you are my favorite sound  
'Cause you're always down for  
  
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
When your arms are around me  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
It's been a long hard road, and it's only just begun, my friend  
And this I know  
You helped me carry the load  
'Cause you're always down for  
  
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
Well, you're always around  
You're my favourite sound  
  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
When your arms are around me  
I don't wanna let you go  
  
I don't wanna let you go  
'Cause you lift me up now  
Well, you're always around..  
You're my favourite sound  
Lift me up now  
You lift me up  
Lift me up now  
Yeah, you're always around  
You're my favourite sound  
  
Lift me up


If I could right the wrongs that made you cry  
I make a promise not to say good-night  
"Cause I'm holding on  
With a love so strong  
And I can't take a day without you by my side  
  
Girl if i could change  
If I could change your mind  
Baby you could help me wipe these tears from my eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
Girl don't stop  
The sun from shining down on me  
'Cause I can't face another day without your smile  
And if you take away the love and arms that surround me  
The I might break down and cry just like a child  
  
Girl,I can't belong and I won't be free  
If I fail to bring your lovin' back to me  
So I'm pressin' on  
I hope you understand  
There's a broken heart that lies inside your hands  
  
So if I could change  
And it won't hurt your pride  
Baby you could help me stop these tears that I cry  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like a child  
Just like a child  
With the spirits running free  
She showed my why  
Oh, she did  
  
Like a child(oh baby)  
Just like a child  
Think of what our love could be  
If our hearts could set us free  
Like a child  
  
[Chorus]


Oh no  
Take what you need 'cause I can't hold my breath  
Say what you feel 'cause I got nothing left, oh  
I made a promise to myself last night  
I'm gonna keep it if it's wrong or right  
  
[Chorus]  
And if I lose it all  
There'll be nothing left to lose and I would take the fall  
'Cause knowing you are out there breathing  
It's so wonderful, it's a chance I take even if I break it  
I lose it all, if I lose it all  
  
Wouldn't matter anyway  
  
Don't change a thing  
Perfect as you are  
Time has a way  
Time is all I've got  
If my heart should shatter watching you  
That'd be one less thing I'd have to prove  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And we will be waiting when I fall into your open arms  
I believe you'll find me there  
You'll find me there  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Wouldn't matter anyway

Yeahh  
Ooohh  
Yeah yeah  
  
Once there was a time love was just a myth  
It just wasn't for real, didn't exist  
Til the day you came into my life  
You forced me to think twice  
I didn't have too much, no I wasn't rich  
Gave me belief someday I'd be more than this  
That's why until this day I'm still your man  
Cause you made me understand that  
  
Love is kisses in a bean bag chair  
The two of us but no one there  
Love is the moment that I climb the stairs  
To hold you in my arms after we make love  
Love is waking up to see your face  
Or kissing in the morning rain  
Love is  
The only thing that keeps me sane  
At the end of the day is that I've got you  
  
You're my secret place where I can be myself  
You connect with me like nobody else  
Even though our circumstances changed  
Our love still remains  
Meet me on the ground, still you help me fly  
You taught me to be patient, I taught you to rely  
So no matter what tomorrow brings  
We got the simple things cause (noooo)  
  
Love is kisses in a bean bag chair (bean bag chair)  
The two of us but no one there (no one there)  
Love is the moment that I climb the stairs (ohh)  
To hold you in my arms after we make love  
Love is waking up to see your face (ohh)  
Or kissing in the morning rain  
Love is  
The only thing that keeps me sane (ohh)  
At the end of the day is that I've got you  
  
Love is  
A Sunday morning with the blanket wrapped around your waist  
Love is  
The way your lips seem to curve  
When you say my name (say my name ohh)  
Love is  
And when I'm stressing like the world's turning upside down  
Girl it all makes sense when you're around  
  
Love is kisses in a bean bag chair (yeah)  
The two of us but no one there (making love is)  
Love is the moment that I climb the stairs  
To hold you in my arms after we make love  
Love is waking up to see your face (yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
Or kissing in the morning rain  
Love is  
The only thing that keeps me sane (I'm gonna keep you baby)  
At the end of the day is that I've got you  
  
Love is kisses in a bean bag chair (bag chair)  
The two of us but no one there  
Love is the moment that I climb the stairs  
To hold you in my arms after we make love  
Love is waking up to see your face (I've got you baby)  
Or kissing in the morning rain  
Love is (baby)  
The only thing that keeps me sane  
At the end of the day is that I've got you  
  
Love is  
Waking up to see your face (say I've got you)  
Kissing in the morning rain (ooh)  
At the end of the day is that I've got you


[Brian:]  
I won't tell nobody  
I'll just scream it in my mind  
Nothing good in life is scripted  
It's not like we predicted  
That the one you want  
Is gonna be the one you thought  
  
[Nick:]  
I won't tell nobody  
But I won't live like a prisoner  
Nothing has to be so perfect  
Can you tell me was it worth it  
Because her heart can't lie  
And even though her face may try  
Love can keep you up all night  
  
[Chorus (mainly Nick):]  
Cause love will keep you up all night  
It's not something you can decide  
One day you're all alone  
The next you're crying on the phone  
Love will keep you up all night  
You got a taste of sweet divine  
It took you to the other side  
Love will keep you up all night  
  
[Brian:]  
If I don't tell a living soul  
Still everyone would know  
Yes they would  
It's always three am somewhere  
You know it when you get there  
  
[AJ:]  
Some people try to cover it up  
Some people think it's never enough (never enough)  
  
[Chorus (mainly AJ):]  
Cause love will keep you up all night  
It's not something you can decide  
One day you're all alone  
The next you're crying on the phone  
Love will keep you up all night  
You got a taste of sweet divine  
It took you to the other side  
Love will keep you up all night  
  
[Nick:]  
I don't mean to scare you  
But everybody has a first time  
One day when you're old and gray  
Don't look back and never say  
You should have tried  
Stayed up all night  
  
Love will keep you up all night  
It's not something you can decide  
  
[AJ:]  
One day you're all alone  
The next you're crying on the phone  
  
[All:]  
Love will keep you up all night  
You got a taste of sweet divine  
It took you to the other side  
To the other side  
Love will keep you up all night  
It's not something you can decide  
One day you're all alone  
The next you're cryin', you're cryin'  
Love will keep you up all night  
You got a taste of sweet divine  
It took you to the other side  
  
Love will keep you up all night  
Love will keep you up all night  
  
[AJ:]  
Love will keep you up all night


I can see that you've been crying  
You can't hide it with a lie  
What's the use in you denying  
That what you have is wrong  
I heard him promise you forever  
But forever's come and gone  
Baby, he would say whatever  
It takes to keep you blind  
To the truth between the lines, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
I will love you more than that  
I won't say the words  
Then take them back  
Don't give loneliness a chance  
Baby listen to me when I say  
  
I will love you more than that  
  
Baby, you deserve much better  
What's the use in holding on  
Don't you see it's now or never  
'Cause I just can't be friends  
Baby knowing in the end, that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's not a day that passes by  
I don't wonder why we haven't tried  
It's not too late to change your mind  
So take my hand, don't say goodbye  
  
I will love you more than that  
I won't say the words  
Then take them back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I will love you more than that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I will love you more than that


Looking for beauty in a certain  
Finding the strength inside a gray  
Maybe I'm heading for a breakdown  
And maybe that's ok  
Could be I'm hanging on for dear life  
Maybe I need to get a grip  
Cause you're the only one  
That makes me feel like this  
So  
  
[Chorus]  
Save me I'm falling again  
Keep me from breakin' in a million pieces  
In the end no matter what I do  
There's nowhere, nowhere to go  
  
Nowhere to go but you  
  
Tryin' to make nothing out of something  
Promise myself I wouldn't care  
Maybe you're making me a liar cause I'm sitting here  
You finally crackin' my resistance  
And find a way to wear me down  
  
Yea, I just look at you  
And there's no way out  
  
Every single road I take (it's you)  
Asleep or wide awake (I know it's you)  
And it's too late for anyone to save me  
  
I'm falling again  
Keep me from breakin' in a million pieces  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Nowhere to go but you


[Nick:]  
Stop it, stop it  
Stop it, stop it  
Go, stop and go  
I just hit static  
I used to read you  
Loud and clear  
Not like this  
It's so erratic  
  
[Brian:]  
And I'm not rational  
When I see you around  
Your inconsistency  
And you know it's dragging me down  
You're so conflicted baby  
  
[Chorus:]  
You're always walking away  
One step and everything's over  
And you're running back to me  
You say I let you down  
Baby take me in or just take me out  
I'm already dead  
I already said (I already said) I'm sorry  
  
[Nick:]  
Stop it  
I've made mistakes  
I've been an addict  
A blind fanatic  
Don't you know  
You're not immune to the panic  
With somebody  
  
[Brian:]  
When the snow hits your skin  
The cold don't last forever  
But you're livin' again  
If you don't let seasons change  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
[AJ:]  
How many times do I have to say it  
Before you believe me  
  
[Nick:]  
Stop it, stop it  
Stop and go  
  
[All:] Panic!  
  
[Repeat Chorus]


Yeah yeah yeah  
Julie was a long way from home  
She can make alone look pretty  
Her attitude made a part of her landscape  
Riding her bike through alphabet city  
  
She likes to party in the backseat, under the bridge on the Brooklyn side  
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow, taking bets till the sun won't rise  
She said "what good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"  
She can lick her lips and smile and make you want to believe  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game  
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl  
(Right now right now ooh ooh ooh)  
  
Julie likes to shop lift in stores  
Right alongside the rich and famous  
Get in elevators, press emergency stop  
And make love on the floor until the camera made us  
  
And no woman in the world ever made me feel like my heart's on fire  
When she walked, I followed, when she laughed, I cried,  
"What good is tomorrow without a guarantee?"  
And I was wrapped around her finger, and I began to believe  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game  
That your life is just a chain reaction, taking you day by day  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game  
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world (crazy world)  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl  
  
Tell me what you want from me  
I've got everything you need  
It's getting hard for me to breathe  
Let me be your guarantee  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game (a game)  
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day (by day)  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl (poster girl)  
  
That the consequences of your actions really are just a game (just a game)  
That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day  
She says nothing's forever in this crazy world (crazy world)  
Still I'm falling in love with the right now poster girl  
  
Right now, right now  
Right now, oh oh oh  
Poster girl  
Poster girl  
Come on, come on


Baby, oh  
  
Even in my heart I see  
You're not bein' true to me  
Deep within my soul I feel  
Nothing's like it used to be  
  
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time  
Impossible as it may seem  
But I wish I could so bad, baby  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
Before you tear us apart (my heart)  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
I should've known from the start  
You know you got to stop (from my heart)  
You're tearing us apart (my heart)  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
  
I live my life the way  
To keep you comin' back to me  
Everything I do is for you  
So what is it that you can't see  
  
Sometimes I wish I could turn back time  
Impossible as it may seem  
But I wish I could so bad, baby  
You better quit playin' games with my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
Baby, baby the love that we had was so strong  
Don't leave me hangin' here forever  
Oh baby, baby this is not right, let's stop this tonight  
  
Baby, (oh) quit playin' games  
Baby  
  
Sometimes I wish I could  
Turn back time, impossible as it may seem  
But I wish I could so bad, baby  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
Baby  
  
Quit playin' games with my heart  
(my heart)  
Baby (my heart)  
  
With my heart


[Nick:]  
Ooh  
How many times am I gonna let you walk right past  
I swear sometimes I think I'm moving too fast  
You never know if it's gonna last  
I guess that's what scares me sometimes  
  
[Brian:]  
Ooh  
I know it ain't right but I don't wanna let me care  
I wanna know love but I'm a little scared  
You never know what you're gonna get  
And that is what scares me sometimes, times  
  
The next time love comes my way  
I'm gonna let it happen, happen baby  
If ever I make, made a mistake  
I've been a rebel too long  
A rebel too long, a rebel too long  
(A rebel too long)  
  
[Aj:]  
Yeah  
I don't hurt people that don't hurt me back, yeah  
I turned to war and I'm so tired of that (Mhmm)  
I'm ready to walk my guides down  
I'm done playing tough guy for now, for now  
  
[Aj:]  
Everybody deserves taking chances  
And that only flies in certain circumstances  
Can't keep running away from these feelings  
Everybody needs someone sometimes  
Sometime  
  
The next time love comes my way  
I'm gonna let it happen, happen baby  
If ever I make, made a mistake  
I've been a rebel too long  
A rebel too long, a rebel too long  
(A rebel too long)  
  
[Howie:]  
And before this moment fades away  
I wanted you to know I made mistakes  
But even if there's no more words to say  
I tried to be better without you  
  
The next time love comes my way  
I'm gonna let it happen, happen baby  
If ever I make, made a mistake  
I've been a rebel too long  
A rebel too long, a rebel too long  
(A rebel too long)  
  
The next time love comes my way  
I'm gonna let it happen, happen baby  
If ever I make, made a mistake  
I've been a rebel too long  
A rebel too long, a rebel too long  
(A rebel too long)  
Oh


Roll with it  
Roll with it  
Roll with it  
You've got to roll with it  
  
If you ever feel like no one cares  
When you try your best but you get nowhere  
Don't give in  
'Cause the times will come again  
When they criticize every move you make  
And you've had as much as you're gonna take  
Don't you worry  
Soon enough things will change  
  
Bridge  
  
And when it seems as though  
Nobody understands a man  
(understands)  
Don't let your head hang down  
You want to just stick to the plan  
  
[Chorus]  
Roll with it  
That's what you gotta do  
Roll with it  
Roll with it  
You've got to roll with it  
That's what you gotta do  
Roll with it  
Just roll, roll, roll with it  
Roll with it  
You've got to roll with it  
  
Just roll with it  
Everything will be fine  
Just roll with it  
It's gonna be alright  
Just roll with it  
Don't put yourself down  
Just roll with it  
  
If you just can't find someone to trust  
When you give your heart but you don't get much  
Don't you worry the time is gonna come  
  
The world's a school  
So much to learn  
So learn it well  
The world's a stage  
So act the fool  
No woman understands  
You've got to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just roll with it  
Just roll with it  
Just roll with it  
Everybody just roll with it  
Just roll with it  
Come on now  
Just roll with it  
That's what you gotta do  
Just roll with it  
Backstreet says  
Roll with it  
Come on y'all  
Roll with it  
  
All the fellas roll  
Roll with it  
All the ladies roll  
Roll with it  
Everybody roll  
You've got to roll with it  
Just roll  
Roll with it  
Just roll with it  
You've got to roll with it  
You've got to  
You've got to  
You've got to  
Roll  
  
Everybody  
Anybody  
Everybody roll with it  
Everybody  
Anybody  
Everybody roll  
Everybody roll  
Everybody roll


You washed away my sad face  
And flooded all my empty space  
You take away life's heartbreak  
And I know with you it's gonna be okay  
  
You're rushing through me (like water from heaven)  
I feel you moving through me (like sand in the sea)  
And now I feel so alive  
So alive (you're the air in my atomosphere)  
Finally I feel complete  
'Cause you are rushed over me yeah  
  
There's no more blindness  
When I cry, I'm smiling  
You kept me from dying  
And I know with you I'll keep on living  
  
You're rushing through me (like water from heaven)  
I feel you moving through me (like sand in the sea)  
And now I feel so alive  
So alive (you're the air in my atomosphere)  
Finally I feel complete  
'Cause you are rushed over me  
  
It's not enough  
Just holding on  
Before I met you  
I was lost  
Now that you're standing here  
I don't want you to go  
'Cause I know, that your love keeps me alive  
  
You're rushing through me (like water from heaven)  
I feel you moving through me (like sand in the sea)  
And now I feel so alive  
So alive (you're the air in my atomosphere)  
Finally I feel complete  
'Cause you have rushed over me  
  
You're rushing through me (like water from heaven)  
I feel you moving through me (like sand in the sea)  
And now I feel so alive  
So alive (you're the air in my atomosphere)  
Finally I feel complete  
'Cause you have rushed over me


Yeah, yeah  
It seems like yesterday when I said "I do"  
And after all this time my heart still burns for you  
If you don't know by now that you're my only one  
Take a look inside me and watch my heartstrings come undone  
  
I know I promised you forever  
Is there no stronger word I can use  
To reassure you when the storm is raging outside  
You're my safest place to hide  
  
Can you see me, here I am  
I need you like I needed you then  
When I feel like giving up  
I promise inside your heart I'd still fine  
You're my safest place to hide  
  
You see colors no one else can see  
In every breath you hear a symphony  
You understand me like nobody can  
I feel like my soul unfolding like a flower blooming  
  
When this whole world gets too crazy  
And there's nowhere left to go  
I know you give me sanctuary  
You're the only truth I know  
You're the road back home  
  
Can you see me, here I am  
Standing here where I've always been  
And when words are not enough  
I promise inside your heart I'd still fine  
You're my safest place to hide  
My safest place to hide  
  
I know I promised you forever  
There's no stronger word I can use  
To reassure when the storm is raging outside  
You're my safest place to hide  
  
Oh! Can you see me, here I am  
Standing here where I've always been  
When I feel like giving up  
I promise inside your heart I'd still find  
Yeah, yeah  
You're my safest place to hide, oh yeah  
You're my safest place to hide


Here I am again  
Waiting on the moment you decide  
To leave me stranded on the edge of nowhere  
I?ve been so close to you so many times  
I feel like I could drown  
I wish that I could fly away from here  
All:  
But I?m still coming down  
AJ:  
From the last time  
All:  
That you came around  
AJ:  
In the starlight  
All:  
Now I?m pulled into your gravity  
Spinning helplessly  
I?m falling through the night  
Like a lonely satellite  
AJ:  
Like a lonely satellite  
Nick:  
We walked on Jupiter  
Flew around the moon a time or two  
Left a mark on every star we could find  
But now I?m burning like a meteor  
That never hits the ground  
Wish that I could fly away from you  
All:  
But I?m still coming down  
AJ:  
From the last time  
All:  
That you came around  
AJ:  
In the starlight  
All:  
Now I?m pulled into your gravity  
Spinning helplessly  
I?m falling through the night  
Like a lonely satellite  
Nick:  
Love is poisoning the atmosphere  
Is keeping everything unclear to me  
Howie:  
Something in your eyes  
Never satisfies  
I?m feeling so alone, tonight  
All:  
But I?m still coming down (still coming down)  
From the last time (the last time)  
That you came around (you came around)  
In the starlight (the starlight)  
Now I?m pulled into your gravity (ooooh)  
Spinning helplessly  
I?m falling through the night (falling through the night)  
Yes I?m falling through the night (falling through the night)  
Like a lonely satellite  
Nick:  
Like a lonely satellite  


Oh  
Oh  
Oh oh oh yeah  
Oh no  
Yeah  
  
Shorty ain't got cable,  
She ain't even got a radio, way more than able.  
What kinda girl should I take her for?  
The perfect kind, just what I like,  
Exactly what I had in my mind, a dream  
She's a dream, yeah  
  
Shorty don't know I'm on the red carpet, almost every night.  
And when I'm outta town to go and do work,  
I'm first class every flight.  
If she takes the time to open her eyes,  
She can realize that she's a dream  
'Cause she knows me  
  
'Cause Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity,  
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.  
'Cause every time I take her out, we always in the VIP.  
But Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me  
That's why I make her say, ooh  
Make her say, ah  
Make her say, ooh  
Make her say, ah  
  
Shorty don't know who I am  
  
And I'm cool with that, if she says so  
I ain't even got a lot to her  
And when I'm out making pesos?  
Ain't' nobody treat her like I do her.  
'Cause I'm the one that she thinks about,  
The only one on her mind,  
She's a dream  
'Cause she knows me  
And Shorty don't know that I'm on the stage,  
Like three or four times a week  
She don't even know I've been around the world  
And all the different girls I meet.  
But there's just one, face that I see  
She's the only one for me  
She's a dream  
'Cause she knows me  
  
'Cuase Shorty don't know who I am, she don't know I'm a celebrity,  
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.  
'Cause every time I take her out, we always in the VIP.  
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me  
That's why I make her say, ooh  
Make her say, ah  
Make her say, ooh  
Make her say, ah  
(She's a dream)  
  
See, shorty don't know who I am  
That's not good for us, 'cause I know,  
It's not good to fuss  
And I know she loves me, for me  
And I love her, for her  
But It wouldn't work if she ever gave  
A damn 'bout who I am but she knows me  
  
She don't know I'm a celebrity,  
'Cause when I let her meet my fam, ain't nobody mention my pedigree.  
'Cause every time I take her out, we always in the VIP.  
Shorty don't know who I am, but she knows me  
Oh,  
Make her say, ah  
Make her say, ooh  
Make her say, ah  
  
'Bout me  
(She's a dream)


[Chorus]  
You're my shining star  
That is what you are  
There is no one like you baby  
Angels everywhere  
Every time you're near  
You will always be my baby  
  
Baby when you do the things you do  
I want to be close to you  
Cause I need to feel your every move, oh  
Baby I can never say how much  
I need your touch, I can't get enough  
Cause you know what to do to turn me on, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby you're as close as close can get  
And baby you know I'd let  
Every single part of me be yours, ooh yeah  
It doesn't matter if the phone might ring  
Cause I won't hear a thing when I'm in your arms  
Cause you know what to do to turn me on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've never been so satisfied  
With anything in my entire life  
Cause you are doing everything so right  
Oh, oh baby  
I've never been so satisfied  
With anything in my entire life  
Cause you are doing everything so right  
Oh, oh baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know that I adore you  
want to be there everyday for you  
To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby  
You know that I adore you  
want to be there everyday for you  
To satisfy your every needs my baby, baby  
  
[Chorus]


Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces,  
And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons,  
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is,  
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things,  
Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it,  
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it  
Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's running it,  
Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killing me.  
So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be,  
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty,  
There has to be some type of change for this day and age,  
We gotta rearrange and flip the page,  
Living encaged like animals and cannibals,  
Eating each other alive just to survive the nine to five,  
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive  
Peace of mind's so hard to find.  
  
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout  
What's this madness all about  
All this makes me wanna shout  
You know it makes me wanna shout,  
Throw my hands up and shout  
What's this madness all about  
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now  
  
Problems, complications and accusations  
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces  
A war is taking place.  
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace  
Is increasing the height of your spirituality.  
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions  
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living.  
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning,  
But will we live to see the dawn.  
  
How can we preach, when all we make this world to be  
Is a living hell torturing our minds.  
We all must unite, to turn darkness to light,  
And the love in our hearts will shine.  
  
We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting each other  
Whatever happened to protecting each other  
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure,  
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever.  
Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted,  
Family values are contradicted.  
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the pressure is building and I've had enough.  
  
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout  
What's this madness all about  
All this makes me wanna shout  
You know it makes me wanna shout,  
Throw my hands up and shout  
What's this madness all about  
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now


When you come back I won't be here  
She said and gently pulled me near  
If you want to talk you can call  
I know it's not your fault  
  
I just smiled and said let go of me  
But there's something that I've just gotta know  
Did someone else steal my part?  
She said it's not my fault  
  
Then my heart did time in Siberia  
Was waiting for the life to come true  
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious  
When the one you want doesn't want you too  
  
I was drifted in between  
Like I was on the outside looking in, yeah yeah  
In my dreams you are still here  
Like you've always been  
  
Oh yeah, my heart did time in Siberia  
Was waiting for the life to come true  
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious  
When the one you want doesn't want you too  
  
I gave myself away completely  
But you just couldn't see me  
Though I was sleeping in your bed  
'Cause someone else was on your mind  
In your head  
  
When I came back she wasn't there  
Just a note left on the stairs  
If you want to talk give me a call  
  
My heart did time in Siberia  
Was waiting for the life to come true  
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious  
When the one you want doesn't want you too  
When the one that you want doesn't want you  
  
My heart did time in Siberia  
Was waiting for the life to come true  
'Cause it's all so dark and mysterious  
When the one you want doesn't want you too  
  
Siberia, Siberia  
When the one you want doesn't want you too
