I can hound you if I need to
Sip your brandy from a crystal shoe
In the corner, in the corner
While the others climb reaching dizzy heights
The world's in front of me in black and white
I'm on the bottom line, I'm on the bottom line

I'd have a cardiac if I had such luck, ooo
Lucky losers, lucky losers landing on skid row
Landing on skid row
While the Diamond Jims
And the Kings road pimps
Breath heavy in their brand new clothes
I'm on the bottom line, I'm on the bottom line

And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive you need a meal ticket
To stay alive you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain
No regret, no regret
When the line's been signed
You're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest

Shake a hand if you have to
Trust in us and we will love you anyway, anyway
Don't leave us stranded in the jungle
With fifty percent that's hard to handle
Ain't that so, ain't that so

And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive you need a meal ticket
To stay alive you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain
No regret, no regret
When the line's been signed
You're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest

Meal ticket

Gotta get a meal ticket
And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive you need a meal ticket
To stay alive you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain
No regret, no regret
When the line's been signed
You're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest

Meal ticket
Meal ticket
Meal ticket
Meal ticket
Meal ticket


Hold up, y'all
Hold up
Not yet
Hold up

Now
Go 'head
Go 'head

Like that
Yeah
Mm

That's cool

Ooh

Bring it in
I heard that; come on, and play that back
I'm really feeling that; come on, smash track
It's just the regular two-man show

I heard that; come on, and play that back
I'm really feeling that; come on, smash track
It's just the regular two-man show

Doesn't it sound good to ya, don't you agree?
Doesn't it sound good to ya, don't you agree?

Come on, break it down
What
Huh
Oh

I heard that; come on, and play that back
I'm really feeling that; come on, smash track
It's just the regular two-man show

I heard that; come on, and play that back
I'm really feeling that; come on, smash track
It's just the regular two-man show

Oh

Doesn't it sound good to ya, don't you agree?
Doesn't it sound good to ya, don't you agree?

Listen to me right here

I like that
Gimmie, gimmie that
Come on

Take it to the high level
Go a lil' higher then that
Higher
Switch it up
I like that
I like that

Kill 'em

I like that
Grab yo' lady and hug her tight
Uh huh, uh huh

Shock value


I can hear your heart
Pounding in my ear
Now I feel the sound
And the time is near
I feel the taste
Of all the things you do
Now the time has come
I know you're a dream come true
You make me so complete
With the things you do
And the music's sweet
You make me feel brand new
I hear the sound
Songs start coming through
Somehow I know
That you're a dream come true

[Chorus]
It takes my breath
When it sounds that way
Seems like you
Chase the clouds away
And I feel so good
Each and every day

And life is good
Each and every way
Now I feel the beat
Of the dancing drums
And now I know we're
Gonna have some fun
Now the time stands still
And the blues are through
And now I know
What I'm gonna do
Now I feel the beat
Of the dancing drums
And now I know we're
Gonna have some fun
Now the time stands still
And all the blues are through
Now I know
What I'm gonna do

[Chorus]


Don't shy away from coming in
Closer still my darling friend
Don't slip, don't trip on life
I bear the moon
Inside your eyes
Don't be afraid of all my years
What you see or what you hear
It's all yours and yours and yours alone
Yours for the taking, so take it home

Oh it's a good heart
To be a part of
Just a soulful woman tend to love
The kind of love you never knew
Oh it's a good heart from me to you

Oh sure it's cracked a time or two
But him and me, we pulled on through
I've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em go
Some went through fast
Some went real slow
So take a chance, and take your time
Reading my face between the lines
I love real good, and I love you
My heart and me
That's what we do

Oh it's a good heart
To be a part of
Just a soulful women tend to love
The kind of love you never knew
Oh it's a good heart from me to you

Oh it's a good heart
To be a part of
Just a soulful woman tend to love
The kind of love you never knew
Oh it's a good heart from me to you

The kind of love you never knew
Oh it's a good heart, from me to you
Oh it's a good heart, from me to you


It's so strange he doesn't show me more affection than he needs 
Almost formal, too respectful, never takes romantic leads 
There are times when I imagine I'm not always on his mind 
He's not thinking what I'm thinking, always half a beat behind 
Always half a beat behind 

I'm in every kind of trouble, can't you tell, just look at me 
Half ecstatic, half dejected, all in all I'm all at sea 
Easy turns I thought I wanted, fill me now with chilling dread 
You can never know the chaos, of a life turned on it's head 
Of a life turned on it's head 


Take a little time to panic, shake off your complacent state 
I know all I ever wished to, of a life destroyed by fate 
It's so strange you never notice anything but where you are 
Step outside your gleaming prison, or is that a step too far 
Or is that a step too far


Lily pulled a horseshoe from a pile of junk
Said I'm gonna keep this good luck piece
Of iron inside my truck
The boy just whispered OK
And grabbed his old black dog
As we piled on in and cut out through
That late November fog

Dull as a plowshare rusting in the yard
Old Cotton grinned and waved goodbye
While the auctioneers all played cards
On every other Sunday
I'd walk down to Moe's and back
Eat a t-bone steak, watch a picture show,
For a dollar and a half

Come on little sister get up offa my knee
Gonna settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Gonna set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee

That fog came out of nowhere
Short of what I can tell
Hand to hand we passed that bucket
Up and down from the well
Gone to California
Used to be what folks would say
Down around these parts if it was me
I'd have hoped that west bound stage

Come on little sister get up offa my knee
Gonna settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Gonna set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee

One less hallelujah
A little less sympathy
Lily and Jake, the old black dog
A pinewood box, a rocking horse
All gone to Jubilee

Come on little sister get up offa my knee
Gonna settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Gonna set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee


I don't know why
I just know I do
I just can't explain
In this language that I use
Something leaves me speechless
Each time that you approach
Each time you glide right through me
As if I was a ghost

If I only could tell you
If you only would listen
I've got a line or two to use on you
I've got a romance we could christen

And there's a word in Spanish I don't understand
But I heard it in a film one time spoken by the leading man
He said it with devotion, he sounded so sincere
And the words he spoke in Spanish brought the female lead to tears
A word in Spanish, a word in Spanish

If you can't comprehend
Read it in my eyes
If you don't understand it's love
In a thin disguise
And what it takes to move you
Each time that you resist
Is more than just a pretty face
To prove that I exist

When manners make no difference
And my gifts all lay undone
I trade my accent in on chance
And fall back on a foreign tongue


Abide with me, fast forth the eventide
The darkness deepens, Lord abide with me
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, O abide with me

I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless
Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness
Where is death's sting, where, grave, that victory
I triumph still if Thou abide with me

Hold Thou thy cross before my closen eyes
Shine throught the gloom and point me to the skies
Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee
In life, in death, O Lord abide with me
In life, in death, O Lord abide with me


Good taste at times I've sometimes lacked
I won't deny the truth
I got dressed up as Donald Duck
Making up for my repressed youth
Disco balls and spandex pants
On questionable friends
Disco died but how the fog still rolled across the River Thames

Snarling they just came along
And cut us to the quick
Called us a bunch of dinosaurs
And gave us a load of sticks
Told us that the times was changing
And all good things must end
But I'm still here and the fog still rolls across the River Thames

Nelson's on his column
Ravens are in the Tower
Big Ben never lost his voice
Chimes on every hour
And the fog still rolls off the River Thames
The forecast calls for rain
London Bridge ain't falling down
And some things never change

The black-faced boys were holding tight
And Thatcher's in a noose
Hair got teased beyond belief
In the age of the golden goose
The new romantics claimed the throne
And we were wondering when
But they lost their crown and the fog still rolled across the River Thames
Big bold letters screaming out
A scandal in the house
Dogs without their vocal chords
Careers going south
What the eye can't see the eye invents
The truth was meant to bend
But nothing changed and the fog still rolled across the River Thames

Nelson's on his column
Ravens are in the Tower
Big Ben never lost his voice
Chimes on every hour
And the fog still rolls off the River Thames
The forecast calls for rain
London Bridge ain't falling down
And some things never change

Nelson's on his column
Ravens are in the Tower
Big Ben never lost his voice
Chimes on every hour
And the fog still rolls off the River Thames
The forecast calls for rain
London Bridge ain't falling down
And some things never change


This ain't no battle honey, this ain't no fight
How come you take it so hard when I stay out all night
If I take a drink, is that against the law
And if I have a good time, do you call that an act of war

Well you better believe it boy, this house is your home
I didn't build it up for you to live here on my own
And if you think it's easy to forget about me
You'd better think twice, you'd better believe it's an act of war

We're living on the front line you and me
Fighting on this battleground of misery
Oh go ahead bring on your artillery
And we'll make this an act of war
Give it all you've got `cause I'm all dug in
Keep the punches coming I can take them on the chin
Winner takes all, let the best man win
And we call it an act of war

Well I'm a man of convenience I work a long hard day
After twelve long hours ain't I got the right to play
If living together is getting in the way
Then I call that an act of war

Well if that's your game then honey two can play
I'm going on the town tonight and have some fun my way
Ain't no way baby this girl's gonna stay
I call it, I call it an act of war

And it looks like time ain't been on our side
If we could turn the clock back
We might survive this act of war


Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.

I got your picture hangin' on the wall,
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name.
I realize it's just a picture inside a frame.

I read your letters when you're not near me,
But they don't move me, and they don't groove me
Like when I hear your sweet voice whispering in my ear.
I play the game, a fantasy.
I pretend I'm not in reality.
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me.

I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you're gone,
I'm well aware nothin' can take the place of you being there.
No other sound is quite the same as your name.
No touch can do half as much to make me feel better,
So let's get together.

Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby.
Ain't nothing like the real thing.


The sister of sunlight
Comes to my lonely life
Bearing the crosses I hung
I hung on my lonely wife
And the anchor told me
If I prayed by the river
That the sweet sound of water
Would always go with her

All across the havens to the waterfall
They told me I would meet her there
Inside those icy walls
But how on earth in this universe
Can they forgive me of my pains
For all across the havens
I must stumble locked in chains

Then the mother of mercy
Showed me her stable
And told me you would be safe
Safe in her cradle
And the waterfall opened
And the water withdrew
Leaving me standing
On a road leading through


All quiet on the Western Front, nobody saw
A youth asleep in the foreign soil, planted by the war
Feel the pulse of human blood pouring forth
See the stems of Europe bend under force

All quiet
All quiet
All quiet on the Western Front

So tired of this garden's grief, nobody cares
Old kin kiss the small white cross, their only souvenir
See the Prussian offense fly, weren't we grand
To place the feel of cold sharp steel in their hands

It's gone all quiet on the Western Front, male angels sigh
Ghosts float in a flooded trench as Germany dies
Fever reaps the flowers of France, fair-haired boys
String the harps to Victory's voice, joyous noise


Breaking down
Never seems to be that hard
Falling short
Is always in the cards
I'm on the road
Sun rising at my back
Lost it all
Somewhere between the cracks

I always hoped that I'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we're delivered
Then there are the lucky ones

And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me I'm thankful now
The walls get higher every day
The barriers get in the way
But I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful; thankful 
I'm thankful; so thankful; I'm thankful 
I've got all that I'm allowed

Leaving town
Gets to feel just like a job
My desire
Never winds up on top
I can't say now
I didn't want the moon
It's out of reach
Somewhere beyond this room

I always hoped that I'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we're delivered
Then there are the lucky ones

And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me I'm thankful now
The walls get higher every day
The barriers get in the way
But I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful; thankful 
I'm thankful; so thankful; I'm thankful 
I've got all that I'm allowed

I've always tried to make things clear
Then I watched as progress stalled
I only hope I'm standing here
When Heaven finally comes to call

And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me I'm thankful now
The walls get higher every day
The barriers get in the way
But I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful; thankful 
I'm thankful; so thankful; I'm thankful 
I've got all that I'm allowed

Thankful; I'm thankful;
So thankful; I'm thankful 
I've got all that I'm allowed

All that I'm allowed

I'm thankful
And I've got all that I'm allowed
So thankful
And I've got all that I'm allowed


Raised to be a lady by the golden rule
Alice was the spawn of a public school
With a double-barrel name in the back of her brain
And a simple case of mummy-doesn't-love-me blues

Reality it seems, was just a dream
She couldn't get it on with the boys on the scene
But what do you expect from a chick who's just sixteen?
And hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey) you know what I mean

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice, it's my turn today

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me?
Wait till my husband's away

Poor little darling with a chip out of her heart
It's like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part
Getting your kicks in another girl's bed
And it was only last Tuesday they found you in the subway dead

And who could you call your friends down in Soho?
One or two middle-aged dykes in a Go-Go
And what do you expect from a sixteen year old yo-yo
And hey, hey, hey (hey, hey, hey) oh don't you know?

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice, it's my turn today

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me?
Wait till my husband's away


If it came to pass that they should ask
What could I tell them
Would they criticize behind my back
Maybe I should let them
Oh if only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man

If they could face it
I could take it in their eyes
Oh I know I'd make it
Their tiny minds
And sacred cows, just fake it
Oh if only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man

But I know the way they want me
In the way they publicize
If they could turn their focus off
To the image in their eyes
Maybe it would help them, help them understand
Maybe it would help them, help them understand
Maybe it would help them, help them understand
That a full-blooded city boy
Is now a full-blooded city man

Oh my soul
Oh my soul
Oh my soul

Oh my soul
Oh my soul
Oh my soul

Oh my soul
Oh my soul
Oh my soul

Oh my soul
Oh my soul
Oh my soul

Oh my soul
Oh my soul
Oh my soul

Oh my soul
Oh my soul
Oh my soul

Oh my soul
Oh my soul
Oh my soul

Oh my soul
Oh my soul
Oh my soul

Oh my soul
Oh my soul
Oh my soul

Oh my soul
Oh my soul
Oh my soul


You're a cool little one
My dark southern breeze
Sweeps through my fingers
And it amazes me

Dixie shadowland
Your envy shelters me
Lay down your burden
Mystery of ebony

And it amazes me
Oh it amazes me
Maybe the heat babe could be this tune
It amazes me
It amazes me
What drives me crazy is that big fat yellow moon

Look up that pale light
Well she's waking the trees
I'm drifting in your hoodoo
And it amazes me

That magnolia state
Got a hold on me
I got no blues to preach
Just Mississippi company

Ain't no magic potion
No gri-gri on her side
She's bound to my salvation
Sweet little mama
Take me down by the river tonight
And it amazes me


Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen 

See the little baby 
Wrapped in a manger 
On Christmas Morning 
Amen, Amen, Amen 

See him in the Temple 
Talking with the Elders 
Tomorrows Wisdom 
Amen, Amen, Amen 
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen 

Down at the Jordan 
And John was baptising 
And Savin' all sinners 
Amen, Amen, Amen 

See 'em at the Seaside 
Talking with the fisherman 
And makin' disciples 
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen 
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen 

Sing it through the mountains


Seen him playing in his backyard
Young boy just starting out
So much history in this landscape
So much confusion, so much doubt

Been there drinking on that front porch
Angry kids, mean and dumb
Looks like a painting, that blue skyline
God hates fags where we come from

'Western skies' don't make it right
'Home of the brave' don't make no sense
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire
Left to die on a high ridge fence

It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming

See two coyotes run down a deer
Hate what we don't understand
You pioneers give us your children
But it's your blood that stains their hands

Somewhere that road forks up ahead
To ignorance and innocence
Three lives drift on different winds
Two lives ruined, one life spent


Lately I've been thinking how much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in the cornfield brightening the daybreak
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child

And when it rains the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other

I can see you sitting eating apples in the evening
The fruit juice flowing slowly, slowly, slowly
Down the bronze of your body
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay like a puppy child

And when it rains the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other

Oh if only I could nestle in the cradle of your cabin
My arms around your shoulders the windows wide and open
While the swallow and the sycamore are playing in the valley
Oh I miss you Amoreena like a king bee misses honey

And when it rains the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other

And when it rains the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere in her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing fit to burst upon each other

Lately I've been thinking how much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in the cornfield brightening the daybreak
Living like a lusty flower, running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay like a puppy, like a puppy child


Tread on my face if you like little lady
Turn me inside out if you have to baby
But don't you cross me off your list
Ooo I am young and I ain't never been kissed
Never been kissed by a lady called Amy

You're far out, you're fab and insane
A woman of the world, it's quite plain
My dad told me Amy's your name
Said he'd break my neck if I played your game
But he can bust my neck 'cause I love you all the same

Amy I know you don't have to show your affection
'Cause the big boys like you and to you I'm an infection
So if you don't want me around
I think I'll run along and drown
You can't want this bum in town, Amy

Amy I know you don't have to show your affection
'Cause the big boys like you and to you I'm an infection
So if you don't want me around
I think I'll run along and drown
You can't want this bum in town, Amy

I'm beaten on the streets `cause I loves ya
I watch you go to work in the summer
I don't whistle at you down the street
I would if I could but I can't whistle you see

Amy I may not be James Dean
Amy I may not be nineteen
And I may still be in romper boots and jeans
But ooo ooo, Amy you're the girl that wrecks my dreams

Amy I may not be James Dean
Amy I may not be nineteen
And I may still be in romper boots and jeans
But ooo ooo, Amy you're the girl that wrecks my dreams


The sun is up and the shades are all pulled down
I'm more paranoid with every little sound
Like the leaf blower blowing the leaves around
And a siren wailing on the other side of town

Oh the TVs on and the colors really hurt my head
If I could think straight I'd wish that I was dead
Or curled up naked in my lover's bed
Instead I'm hanging over Hell suspended by a single thread

[Chorus:]
And I don't recall who said it at this time
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down

With a rolled up note I'm hovering on that line
Three days on a diet of cocaine and wine
And a little weed just to level me sometime
I put the clock in the drawer 'cause I've cancelled out the time

[Chorus]

So don't knock on my door, don't try to call
I'm holed up in this room talking to the wall
When you're high as this you think you know it all
When you're this deep in there's no place else to fall

[Chorus]

And still that saying gets inside my mind
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down


Well, I'm work shy, I'm wild-eyed
So shut that door when the baby cries
Keep me well fed, give me warm bread
Lay my body on a feather bed

And spoil me, Angeline, get to work
When the whistle screams, Angeline

Maybe someday, some way
Somewhere in the future there's more pay
Give me more cash, bring me sour mash
Peel me a grape and fetch my stash

And bite me, Angeline, let me use
You like a sex machine, Angeline

You've got to swing that hammer, punch that card
Angeline, I love you when you work so hard
Swing that hammer and sew my jeans
Angeline just loves it when I treat her mean, Angeline

Well, I talk tough, I act rough
Lay still honey, I can't get enough
And keep your nose clean, let me be
On your knees when you speak to me

And trust me, Angeline and talk real dirty
And I'll make you scream, Angeline

You've got to swing that hammer and punch that card
Angeline, I love you when you work so hard
Swing that hammer and sew my jeans
Angeline just loves it when I treat her mean

You've got to swing that hammer, punch that card
Angeline, I love you when you work so hard
Swing that hammer and sew my jeans
Angeline just loves it when I treat her mean

Angeline just loves it when I treat her mean
Angeline, Angeline, treat her mean, Angeline
Treat her mean, Angeline, treat her mean, Angeline



Well they say that it's a fact
If you watch the sky at night
And if you stare into the darkness
You might see celestial light
And if your heart is empty
And there's no hope in sight
There's a chance you'll find an answer in the sky

Well they say that it's a shame
If you have nothing to believe
And if you can't hold onto something
You might as well die where you sleep
You don't need a prayer
And there's no price to ask why
Sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

And it's all so much bigger than it seems
And it all overwhelms us now and then
And I'm banking on a chance we believe
That good can still control the hearts of men

Sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

And it's all so much bigger than it seems
And it all overwhelms us now and then
And I'm banking on a chance that we believe
That good can still control the hearts of men

This life's a long old road
We shouldn't have to walk alone
But if you find the right companion
You won't feel so worn out when you've grown
All life is precious
And every day's a prize
And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

All life is precious
And every day's a prize
And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky

And sometimes you'll find an answer in the sky


Anyone who ever loved
Could look at me
And know that I love you
Anyone who ever dreamed
Could look at me
And know I dream of you

Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You, you couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me
Like you hurt me
And be so untrue
What am I to do

Every time you go away
I always say it's goodbye dear
Loving you the way I do
I take you back
Without you, I'd die dear
Knowing I love you so

Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You, you couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me
Like you've hurt me
And be so untrue
So what can I do

Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me
Like you hurt me
And be so untrue

Anyone who had a heart
Would love me too
Anyone who had a heart
Would surely take me in her arms
And, and always love me, and love me, love me
Why won't you

Anyone who had a heart
Would love me too
Anyone who had a heart
Would surely take me
Anyone would take me
Why, why won't you
No one's gonna love ya like I do
No one's gonna make you feel the way I do
Yeah
No one
No one, no one, no one, no one


Written by Thom Bell, Leroy Bell and Casey James
Catch a star if you can
Wish for something special
Let it be me, my love is free
Sing a song to yourself
Think of someone listening
One melody, you're all for me

I'll write a symphony just for you and me
If you let me love you, I'll paint a masterpiece
Just for you to see
If you let me love you, let me love you

Are you ready, are you ready for love
Yes I am
Are you, are you ready, are you ready for love
Yes I am
Are you, are you ready, are you ready for love

You're the one like the sun
Shine your love around me
You'll always be the one for me

Say the word and I'll be there
Loving you forever
Don't let me go
Just say it's so

We'll hear the music ring from the mountain tops
To the valley below us
We'll serenade the world
With a lullaby so the angels will know us
Angels will know us


T seems as though I've lived my life
On the bad side of the moon
To stir your dregs in sickness still
Without the rustic spoon

Common people live with me
Where the light has never shone
And the hermits flock like hummingbirds
To speak in a foreign tongue

I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

There ain't no need for watchdogs here
To justify our ways
We live our life in manacles
The main cause of our stay

Exiled here from other worlds
My sentence comes too soon
Why should I be made to pay
On the bad side of the moon


I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
You were the one to blame for tearing my world apart
I got a heart so true, you got a heart of ice
A little more love from you, it could have been paradise

I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
And if it's all the same maybe we should part
And I'm singing do do do
I'm singing do do do

You had to tie me down inside a cage of doubt
I'm sick of being kicked around so this is where I get out

Oh oui baby you tried to hold me but you were slowly
Driving me insane
Oh oui baby

I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
You were the one to blame for tearing my world apart
I got a heart so true, you got a heart of ice
A little more love from you, it could have been paradise

I couldn't take your pain, you couldn't take my love
So I'm gonna quit this game 'cause baby I've had enough


I pulled out my stage coach times
And I read the latest news
I tapped my feet in dumb surprise
And of course I saw they knew

The Pinkertons pulled out my bags
And asked me for my name
I stuttered out my answer
And hung my head in shame

Now they've found me
At last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family

Now they've found me
Well I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun

Now I've seen this chain gang
Lord I say let me see my priest
I couldn't have faced your desert sand
Old burning brown backed beast

The poor house they hit me for my kin
And claimed my crumbling walls
Now I know how Reno felt
When he ran from the law

Now they've found me
At last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family

Now they've found me
Well I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun

Now they've found me
Lord I say at last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family

Lord I say now they've found me
Well I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun

Lord I say now they've found me
At last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family

Now they've found me
I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun


I'm stoned in the twilight
Screaming on the inside
Give me your water, help me survive
Gonna miss the sunlight
When I lose my eyesight

Give me my red shoes, I want to dance
They search for an answer
But that old man wouldn't listen
Back then I was handsome
Back then he was ignorant

And shave off the years now, it's all inside my head
The boy in the red shoes is dancing by my bed
Put them in a box somewhere, put them in a drawer
Take my red shoes, I can't wear them anymore

Had garlands in the wings back then
All the pretty little things back then
Calling out my name, oh what fame brings
After curtain calls and bows
I can't see the front row now
Hand me my red shoes just one more time

They pushed aside our presence
They refused to go the distance
Back then I was Sigmund
Back then he wouldn't listen


Deep inside
My soul fights a war
I can't explain
I can't cross over any more
All I see are dirty faces
Rain and wire
And common sense in pieces
But I try to see through Irish eyes, Belfast.

Look outside
Summer's lost and gone
It's a long walk
On a street of right and wrong
In every inch of sadness
Rock and tanks
Go hand in hand with madness
But I never saw a braver place, Belfast.

And it's sad when they sing
And hollow ears listen
Of smokin' black roses
On the streets of Belfast
And so say your lovers
From under the flowers
Every foot of this world
Needs an inch of Belfast

Who's to say
On whom Heaven smiles
Our different ways
We try harder to recognize
No more enchanted evenings
The pubs are closed
And all the ghosts are leaving
But you'll never let them shut you down,
Belfast.

And it's sad when they sing
And hollow ears listen
Of smokin' black roses
On the streets of Belfast
And so say your lovers
From under the flowers
Every foot of this world
Needs an inch of Belfast

The enemy is not at home
A jealous green
Streaks down this faulty diamond
No bloody boots or crucifix
Can ever hope to split this emerald island
But I never saw a braver place,
Belfast.


I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, costs nothing to touch
War makes money, cancer sleeps
Curled up in my father and that means something to me
Churches and dictators, politics and papers
Everything crumbles sooner or later
But love, I believe in love

I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, no borders to cross
Love is simple, hate breeds
Those who think difference is the child of disease
Father and son make love and guns
Families together kill someone
Without love, I believe in love

Without love I wouldn't believe
In anything that lives and breathes
Without love I'd have no anger
I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here
Without love I wouldn't believe
I couldn't believe in you
And I wouldn't believe in me
Without love

I believe in love
I believe in love
I believe in love


Hey kids, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight
So stick around
You're gonna hear electric music
Solid walls of sound

Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
Uh but they're so spaced out, B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie she's really keen
She's got electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Hey kids, plug into the faithless
Maybe they're blinded
But Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find who's right and who's wrong

Oh Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
Oh but they're so spaced out, Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie she's really keen
She's got electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets

Oh Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
Oh but they're so spaced out, Bennie and the Jets
Oh but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh Bennie she's really keen
She's got electric boots a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine, oh
B-B-B-Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets
Jets, Jets
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie
Bennie, Bennie and the Jets


There was a face on a hoarding that someone had drawn on
And just enough time for the night to pass by without warning
Away in the distance there's a blue flashing light
Someone's in trouble somewhere tonight
As the flickering neon stands ready to fuse
The wind blows away all of yesterday's news

Well they've locked up their daughters and they battened the hatches
They always could find us but they never could catch us
Through the grease streaked window of an all night cafe
We watched the arrested get taken away
And that cigarette haze has ecology beat
As the whores and the drunks file in from the street

'Cause the steam's in the boiler, the coal's in the fire
If you ask how I am, then I'll just say inspired
If the thorn of a rose, is the thorn in your side
Then you're better off dead, if you haven't yet died

'Cause the steam's in the boiler, the coal's in the fire
If you ask how I am, then I'll just say inspired
If the thorn of a rose, is the thorn in your side
Then you're better off dead, if you haven't yet died

Better off dead, better off dead, better off dead
Better off dead, better off dead, better off dead
Better off dead, better of dead


I wonder who's sleeping in your sheets tonight
Whose head rests upon the bed
Could it be a close friend I knew so well
Who seems to be so close to you instead
Close to you instead

I'm blue tonight, I'm red when I'm mad
I'm green when I'm jealous, yellow when I'm sad
I guess I cannot have everything
So much has flown between the years
When I was twenty and you were seventeen

So out of choice I chose rock and roll
But it pushed me to the limit everyday
It turned me into a gypsy, kept me away from home
From there on, there seemed no use for you
For you to stay

And if I shower around 3 a.m.
It's just to wash away
The trace of a love unwanted
Oh in the times I went astray
The times I went astray

So much has flown between the years
When I was twenty and you were seventeen


Now I saw you talking to a cute little slip of a sailor
And it looked at first like the whole thing would end as a failure
He had a thing about a quarter to four
And he just couldn't handle any more
He's got his own big dipper so he won't be needing your big dipper
He's got his own big dipper and he won't be needing yours

So you filled him up with all kinds of stuff to relax him
And you took him down to the fairground after some action
And by around about a quarter to six
You found a different way to get your kicks
Up on the real big dipper where you tried an few new tricks
Big dipper
Up on a great big dipper did you learn a few new licks

He hadn't been too keen at the start
Now he seems to have a change of heart
He's got his own big dipper
Only now he's not so sure, big dipper
He's got his own big dipper
But there's always room for more

Everybody's got a song to sing
Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper

And at around about a quarter to ten
You got up and did it all again
He's got his own big dipper and now he knows just what it's for
Big dipper
He's got his own big dipper but he's got his eye on yours

Another ride, another tune
Another crazy afternoon
Another reason for squeezing your big dipper


Take the wheel I hear the timbers creaking
Take the wheel I think this ship is sinking
Jamaica seems so far and I've been thinking
Old Billy Bones has gone to sea and quit his dockside drinking

Check it out, check it out, check it out
And when I'm dead who'll fly the White Bird home
I'm not the ancient mariner your children know
And the sea's the field these old jack tars have sown
`Cause Billy Bones just wants to know who'll fly the White Bird home

Oh your majesty, your majesty
I heard the boson cry
Old Billy Bones has washed ashore
Upon a foreign tide


There's some things I don't have now
Some things I don't talk about
These things are between myself and I
In my thick skull the joker hides

There's consequences I'm scared to taste
Cold hard truths I can't face
These days are different than the past
Reflections change in the looking glass

And everywhere I look there's something to learn
A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
A hatful of quarters and a naked song
Don't answer the question of where we belong

How come birds
Don't fall from the sky when they die?
How come birds
Always look for a quiet place to hide
These words
Can't explain what I feel inside?
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide

These independent moves I make
This confidence I try to fake
You can hear the beating of my heart
But not a feather falling in the dark

And everything I hear never makes any sense
Another old prophet perched on the fence
A cupful of pencils and a self help guru
Don't answer the question of what I am to you


She slid down to the city limits
Monkey time in fifteen minutes
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance.
Don't let me down
Please stick around
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance.

Strobe light on funky feet,
Soul children in the disco heat.
Top dog, top cat,
Move that muscle and shake that fat.
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance.

Chicago, L.A.
Everyplace, everyway
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance.

Illinois, Santa Fe,
Do do do do do do do what I say
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance.


I'm going on the circuit, I'm doing all the clubs
And I really need a song boys to stir those workers up
And get their wives to sing it with me just like in the pubs
When I worked the good old pubs in Stepney

Oh could you knock a line or two together for a friend
Sentimental tear inducing with a happy end
And we need a tune to open our season at Southend
Can you help us

It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars

I like the warm blue flame, the hazy heat it brings
It loosens up the muscles and forces you to sing
You know it's just another hit and run from the tin pan alley twins

And there's a chance that one day you might write a standard lads
So churn them out quick and fast and we'll still pat your backs
`Cause we need what we can get to launch another dozen acts
Are you working

It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars

It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars

La-de-das, swing stars, swinging stars
It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing


Oh, your black icy snare once cut down my friend

Oh, your black icy snare once cut down my friend

Hair ring molassis abounding
Kool kar kyrie kay salmon
Hair ring molassis abounding
Kool kar kyrie kay salmon

Hair ring molassis abounding
Kool kar kyrie kay salmon
Hair ring molassis abounding
Kool kar kyrie kay salmon

Oh, your black icy snare once cut down my friend

Oh, your black icy snare once cut down my friend


Hey you, you're a child in my head
You haven't walked yet
Your first words have yet to be said
But I swear you'll be blessed

I know you're still just a dream
your eyes might be green
Or the bluest that I've ever seen
Anyway you'll be blessed

And you, you'll be blessed
You'll have the best
I promise you that
I'll pick a star from the sky

Pull your name from a hat
I promise you that, promise you that, promise you that
You'll be blessed

I need you before I'm too old
To have and to hold
To walk with you and watch you grow
And know that you're blessed


I gotta quit this habit
It's like some drug for you
You've been my sweet sweet addict
I've been your little white boy blue

You've got the same obsession
We ain't no cat and mouse
You linger on my lips like confession
You laid the traps in this house

And it's no use each way we lose
You and me at the crossroads of Blue Avenue
Hit and run hearts collide here
True love passes through
Looks like we've got a wreck babe
Up on Blue Avenue
Up on Blue Avenue
Blue Avenue

Two hearts get entangled
Dirty minds they go to town
Everyone's got an angle
Little lies get spread around

Let them say what they want
You and me we already knew
Takes more than hocus pocus babe
To save you from Blue Avenue


Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a deep blue sea
On a blue blue day

Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
When the morning comes
I'll be far away
And I say

Blue eyes holding back the tears
Holding back the pain
Baby's got blue eyes
And she's alone
Again

Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a clear blue sky
Watching over me

Blue eyes
Ooh I love blue eyes
When I'm by her side
Where I long to be
I will see

Blue eyes laughing in the sun
Laughing in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home, and I am home again

Blue eyes laughing in the sun
Laughing in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home again


Every breath is a prayer of some kind
I breathe in, I breathe out, I just breathe
And you're so well, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful to me

Like swimming in your eyes
I dive in, I dive deep, I just swim
I lose myself in you, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful again

Don't you know where you go? I will follow
In your footsteps I find my own feet
Addicted like I am to the blues
Kind of blue of all the blues I need

Yesterday did someone else's song
In sixty-five summertime, don't let go
Long before you came, blue wonderful
The blue wonderful I know

Ain't just something I just left behind
In the past, far away, used to be
But your presence, my blue wonderful
Blue wonderful to me

Go where you want, when you want to
Just don't let the wind tear you free
Stick around the light that brings you home
Don't ever hang around with the breeze

Don't you know where you go? I will follow
In your footsteps I find my own feet
Addicted like I am to the blues
Kind of blue of all the blues I need

Every breath is a prayer of some kind
I breathe in, I breathe out, I just breathe
And you're so well, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful to me

Like swimming in your eyes
I dive in, I dive deep, I just swim
I lose myself in you, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful again

I lose myself in you, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful
Blue wonderful
Blue wonderful
Blue wonderful, again


Your old man got mad when I told him we were leaving
He cursed and he raged and he swore at the ceiling
He called you his child, said honey get wise to his game
He'll get you in trouble I know it, those bums are all the same
There's a Greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us
So tell him goodbye, we gotta go west on that bus

And it's all over now
Don't you worry no more
Gonna go west to the sea
The Greyhound is swaying
And the radio is playing
Some blues for baby and me

And the highway looks like it never did
Lord it looks so sweet and so free
And I can't forget that trip to the west
Singing blues for baby and me

Saw your hands trembling, your eyes opened in surprise
It's ninety in the shade babe, and there ain't a cloud in the sky
I called you my child, said honey now this is our game
There's two of us to play it and I'm happy to be home again
There's a Greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us
So tell him goodbye, we gotta go west on that bus

And it's all over now
Don't you worry no more
We're gonna go west to the sea
The Greyhound is swaying
And the radio's playing
Some blues for baby and me

And the highway looks like it never did
Lord it looks so sweet and so free
And I can't forget that trip to the west
Singing blues for baby and me

And it's all over now
Don't you worry no more
We're gonna go west to the sea
The Greyhound is swaying
And the radio playing
Some blues for baby and me

And the highway looks like it never did
Lord it looks so sweet and so free
And I can't forget that trip to the west
Singing blues for baby and me


He wasn't famous but I sure did love him
I've got his picture in a little frame
He lost his life to a big disease before it even had a name
But there's so many more and I've lost count
The how's and whys aren't important now
All that matters is they came around
And brightened up our lives

She was twenty one with her life ahead
You don't need to know her name
She breathed her last on the cold stone floor of a Hollywood arcade
But fate's right hand isn't always just
Puts a lot of pressure on your faith and trust
She was just a little girl ain't that enough
To rage against the day

[Chorus:]
And how did we get so lucky?
Targets on the rifle range
Who makes the call and who gets to choose?
Who gets to win and who gets to lose?
It's like a rolling dice in the belly of the blues
And blues never fade away
Hey hey hey the colors run when the rain falls
But blues never fade away

He shone so bright with a lust for life
Like the Sun King that he was
His passions hung upon his walls and were printed onto cloth
And for reasons I never understood
About the choices made between the bad and good
I've tried to figure out but
The pain never goes away

[Chorus]

And there's marble markers and little white crosses
Along the beaten path
And I've spread their ashes on the wind
And I miss John Lennon's laugh

[Chorus]

And how did we get so lucky?
Targets on the rifle range
Who makes the call and who gets to choose?
Who gets to win and who gets to lose?

It's like a rolling dice in the belly of the blues
And blues never fade away
Hey hey hey all the colors run when the rain falls
And blues never fade away


Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooo (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo, Gallileo,
Gallileo Figaro - magnifico

But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go will you let me go
Bismillah! No we will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go let me go
Will not let you go let me go (never)
Never let you go let me go
Never let me go ooo
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me
For me
For me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters nothing really matters to me

Anyway the wind blows


Crime in the streets
I read about it everyday in the papers
Justice needs and justice wants
But just in times, yes, too late here
Feels like I wasn't born there
I feel just like a Boogie Pilgrim

Boogie Pilgrim
Hustled to get it
To get it together
Down on the jive talk
Down on the weather
Boogie Pilgrim
Brother I never felt better
No, I never felt better

Low life's complete
When you've lived that way out on the sidewalk
(Walking on the sidewalk everyday)
I got the speed if you got the need
But the need in me needs nothing
(But you know that I need nothing)
But I know that you all want something
Just like Boogie Pilgrim


Holy Moses I have been removed
I have seen the spectre he has been here too
Distant cousin from down the line
Brand of people who ain't my kind
Holy Moses I have been removed

Holy Moses I have been deceived
Now the wind has changed direction and I'll have to leave
Won't you please excuse my frankness but it's not my cup of tea
Holy Moses I have been deceived

I'm going back to the border
Where my affairs, my affairs ain't abused
I can't take any more bad water
Been poisoned from my head down to my shoes

Holy Moses I have been deceived
Holy Moses let us live in peace
Let us strive to find a way to make all hatred cease
There's a man over there
What's his colour I don't care
He's my brother let us live in peace
He's my brother let us live in peace
He's my brother let us live in peace


You've been crying
And there ain't no use denying
It was me
Who put you through this misery
And I'd like to say I'm sorry
But I can't, no I can't
Nothing's gonna change me
Baby, that's the way I am
I was born bad
Always been the same, yes I was born bad
Never gonna change 'cause I was born bad
Only me to blame 'cause I was born bad
Yes I was born bad
Always been my habit, I was born bad
Just can't seem to help it, I was born bad
Always gonna happen, I was born bad
Cause I was born bad
I mistreat you
And you know I always cheat you
But that's me
And that's the it's always been
And I'd like to say I'm sorry
But I can't, no I can't
Nothing's gonna change me
Baby, that's the way I am


I recall how it used to be
In my younger days
I built a wall all around my heart
To keep the pain away
I built it tall, and I built it wide
I left no room for doubt
Your love still found its way inside
And couldn't get back out

I'm breaking down the barriers
Making up my mind
I'm breaking down the barriers of time
I'm taking down the barriers
And loving what I find
I'm breaking down the barriers that lie
Between your love and mine

I guess you know you were not the first
You may not be the last
But you have shown me a better way
And now I'm learning fast
You gotta go where the feeling flows
I take it while it's hot
You gotta give if you want to get
And I want all you got


They used to say that boys are tough as nails
In every way he keeps his heart as guarded as a jail
Now things have changed, I feel so old
Like any girl could drag my heart across the coals

I was always there in the thick of things
I always had the heart of every woman on a string
The danger zone shone from my eyes
It seemed like every inch I gained became a mile

It's not the night reaching in and touching me
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
It seems that time has killed that cruel streak in me
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be

It's not the light shining in and catching me
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
But time has come and cast a spell on me
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be

And now I know what lonely means
I used to give so little and gain everything
The darkest part of every day
Is the shadow of another girl as she turns and walks away

Can't say I blame them all for being hurt
After all, I treated each and every one like dirt
Who wants a heart that's never home?
I face the facts and lock myself into a life alone


You tell me there's an angel in your tree
Did he say he'd come to call on me
For things are getting desperate in our home
Living in the parish of the restless folks I know

Everybody now bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

Burn down the mission
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky

Burn down the mission
Burn it down to stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside

Ah ah ah
Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today
My wife cried when they came to take me away
But what more could I do just to keep her warm
Than burn burn burn burn down the mission walls

Now everybody bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

Burn down the mission Lord
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky

Burn down the mission Lord
If we're gonna stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside


It used to be a sweet sensation
No price too high for love
Now I pay for this bitter taste
And the price is not enough

Such cruel sport for your kicks
Such hard knocks on my heart
How long before the pain ends?
Tell me where living starts

And lovers leap off burning buildings
Waking up on a sky high wire
Desperation leaves us clinging
On the edge of a house on fire

Lovers leap off burning buildings
Live our life on borrowed time
Every flame that ever moved you
Touched your lips but never mine

Lovers leap off burning buildings
No room for conversation
Cold stares and angry words
Fall in pieces from our faces
We read "Do not disturb"

Some lovers just go hungry
Others beg for just a bite
You use me under pressure
To whet your appetite


They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way, I've found more clouds are gray
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
High ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me

It all began so well, but what an end
This is the time a feller needs a friend
When every happy plot ends with a marriage knot
And there's no knot for me


Sober in the morning light
Things look so much different
To how they looked last night
A pale face pressed to an unmade bed
Like flags of many nations flying high above her head

The cellophane still on the flowers
The telegram still in her hand
As whispers circulate all day
Their back-stage baby princess passed away

And you can cage the songbird
But you can't make her sing
And you can trap the free bird
But you'll have to clip her wings
Cause she'll soar like a hawk when she flies
But she'll dive like an eagle when she dies

Promises of no more lies
Fell flat upon an empty stage
Before the audience arrived
A return in time to the cheaper seats
She never knew what lay beneath
Just a dated handbill they found between the sheets

Let down before the final curtain
A shallow heart that left her cold
She left in rouge upon the mirror
A circled kiss to the faithful who'd miss her


I work for the foundry for a penny and a half a day
Like a blind street musician I never see those who pay
It's dirty work in Birmingham
Better deal for a Sheffield man
If he can rivet then his kids can buy
Candy from the candy man

And the van that comes around weekends
Selling fancy city things
Sold by the man with the trilby hat
And the whiskers spread like wings
You can hear him sing
Oh you can hear him sing
Can I put you on, people can I put you on
Tell you that I love you people
Sing a salesman's song and put you on

And a second cousin works in the pits in Newcastle on Tyne
And he don't care if it rains outside, there's coal dust on his mind
It's dirty work in Manchester
But the crew gets paid its gelt
Bang on the bell on Friday
You buys a little something for yourself

And the van that comes around weekends
Selling fancy city things
Sold by the man in the trilby hat
And the whiskers spread like wings
You can hear him sing
Oh you can hear him sing
Can I put you on, people can I put you on
Tell you that I love you people
Sing a salesman's song and put you on


There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling world can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best

There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star crossed voyager beats in time with yours

And can you feel the love tonight
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight
How it's laid to rest
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best


I blew the dust out of the corners
Threw some dead wood on the fire
Tuned the radio to silence
Watched the evening sun expire

Should have called you up this morning
But I'm such a fool at times
I still search my shaving mirror
Looking for your face with mine

And I can't stay alone tonight
Can't let another day go by
Why is it always this way?
Time never seems to really fly
And time is never really on my side
And I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight

Chalk up one more crazy notion
Imagination running wild
But if I needed confirmation
I would have gone that extra mile

You're the last chance on the highway
I'm that open stretch of road
You're the diner in my rear-view
A cup of coffee getting cold

And I can't stay alone tonight
Can't let another day go by
Why is it always this way?
Time never seems to really fly
And time is never really on my side
And I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight

Bruised in this cold war of words
We've come undone two loose ends alone
Possessed by that curse you've endured
The spell that I cast couldn't make you come home

And I can't stay alone tonight
Can't let another day go by
Why is it always this way?
Time never seems to really fly
And time is never really on my side
And I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight


Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the twenty second row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did


Goodbye England's rose;
may you ever grow in our hearts.

You were the grace that placed itself
where lives were torn apart.

You called out to our country,
and you whispered to those in pain.

Now you belong to heaven,
and the stars spell out your name.

And it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind:
never fading with the sunset
when the rain set in.

And your footsteps will always fall here,
along England's greenest hills;
your candle's burned out long before
your legend ever will.

Loveliness we've lost;
these empty days without your smile.

This torch we'll always carry
for our nation's golden child.

And even though we try,
the truth brings us to tears;
all our words cannot express
the joy you brought us through the years.

Goodbye England's rose,
from a country lost without your soul,
who'll miss the wings of your compassion
more than you'll ever know.'


The sound of one heart breaking, the sound of someone waking
To the cold hard truth before the sun goes down
If I could ever catch you a little bit of that
I'd wrap it up and bury it in the deep dark ground

_____ on the ledge with one last chance to beg
To the deepest root of the oldest tree
If we could only bottle a little bit of rain
Wrung out from the history in its ancient leaves

All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place

The never ending stories of the victor and the spoils
The treasure and the lesson to be learned
If I could ever wrap up a little piece of this
I'd strike a match and watch the contents burn

All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place

All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place

Love will always lead to a candlelit bedroom
Only if you want it bad enough
Every waking moment you believe that
You must have a little faith in the light of love
Every waking moment you believe that
You must have a little faith in the light of love


Well I'm keeping off the streets since you came to town
Since you claimed my heart from the lost and found
I have said goodbye to my fooling around
Now you and me babe we got candy by the pound
You and me babe we got candy by the pound

Well I never knew it could feel so good
Be the king of the hill in my neighbourhood
Rain on my roof what a sweet sound
Oh with you underneath it's like candy by the pound
With you underneath it's like candy by the pound

You can tell everybody that this girl of mine
Is sweeter than the grapes hanging from the vine
Love like wine honey drinking till I drown
Keep it coming baby like candy by the pound

Oh no what's come over me
If I am dreaming then let me sleep
Oh wow I'm heaven bound
Love is getting sweeter than candy by the pound

Now I'm ducking in the alley of common sense
Hiding from the claws of my old girl friend
She's screaming murder beating my door down
While I'm right behind it I'm eating candy by the pound
I'm right behind it eating I'm candy by the pound


Captain Fantastic, raised and regimented, hardly a hero
Just someone his mother might know
Very clearly a case for Corn Flakes and classics
"Two teas both with sugar please"
In the back of an alley

While little dirt cowboys turned brown in their saddles
Sweet chocolate biscuits and red rosy apples in summer
For it's hay make and "Hey mom, do the papers say anything good
Are there chances in life for little dirt cowboys
Should I make my way out of my home in the woods"

Brown Dirt Cowboy, still green and growing
City slick Captain
Fantastic the feedback
The honey, the hive could be holding
For there's weak winged young sparrows that starve in the winter
Broken young children on the wheels of the winners
And the sixty-eight summer festival wallflowers are thinning

For cheap easy meals, hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town

And all this talk of Jesus coming back to see us
Mmm mmm couldn't fool us
For we were spinning out our lines walking on the wire
Hand in hand went music and the rhyme
The Captain and the Kid stepping in the ring
From here on sonny sonny sonny, it's a long and lonely climb

For cheap easy meals, hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town

We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town


[Instrumental]


If your life is dull and dreary
And you're feeling rather weary
Of the mundane things that clutter up one's life
Drive your roller up to Bond Street

Where royalty and Sheiks meet
Make your day
Here's the thing to do
Spend a grand or two at Cartier


The last I heard of you
You were somewhere on a cruise in the Mediterranean
So imagine my surprise to see you very much alive
In the English rain again

And I can still recall wet afternoons
When we were small and simply childish
But you've created your own ghost
And the need you have is more than most to hide it

Oh, Chameleon, you're stealing your way back into my eyes
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
You're a devil, you're a devil in disguise
Do you really change me, or am I going crazy
Chameleon, Chameleon, Chameleon, you're free again my child

I remember still those lazy summer days
We'd kill out hunting danger
And we were alien to all outsiders
We had no desire to talk to strangers


Spring is here, the sky is blue
Birds will sing as if they knew
Today's the day, we'll say "i do"
And we'll never be lonely any more

Because we're going to the chapel
And we're gonna to get married
Going to the chapel
And we're gonna get married
Gee i really love you
And we're gonna get married
Going to the chapel of love

Bells will ring, the sun will shine
I will be hers, and she'll be mine
We'll love until the end of time
And we'll never be lonely any more


I built a wall in China, I sank an ocean liner
I've wrecked homes, I've burned thrones, chasing the crown
I've put thorns in your feet, I spread plague in the streets
I've sprung traps, confused maps, chasing the crown

I'm chasing the crown till he bites the apple
I was licking my lips till his Son come down
I'm chasing the crown, the crown, I'm chasing the crown
I'm taking a turn in the right direction
By leaving his soul in the lost and found
I'm chasing the crown, I'm chasing the crown

I saw the tea float in Boston, I saw the live wire shock them
I made them float, I made them drown, chasing the crown
I laid the desert sands, I froze the polar caps
Well, they'd dry out, and I'd shout "Hey I'm chasing the crown"


We are currently missing these lyrics.


How come you're so understanding 
When I tell you all my lies
And pretending to believe them
See through all my alibis
And I need you more than ever
And I want you till the end... Chloe

How you handle what you live through
I can never hope to learn
Taking all the pain I give you
Loving blindly in return
And I need you more than ever
I will always be your friend
Chloe, Chloe

[Chorus]
Chloe, what you gonna do about me
Chloe, what you gonna do
What you gonna do about me

You're the lifeline that I cling to
When I feel like giving in
When the dreams that I rely on
Start to wear a little thin
Then I need you more than ever
And I want you till the end
Chloe, Chloe

[Chorus]


From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the Sun
There's more to be seen than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done

Some say eat or be eaten
Some say live and let live
But all are agreed as they join the stampede
You should never take more than you give

In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life

Some of us fall by the wayside
And some of us soar to the stars
And some of us sail through our troubles
And some have to live with the scars

There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the Sun rolling high through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

In the circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life

It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life

On the path unwinding
In the circle, the circle of life


You're holding back
You're hard to read
Your a twenty-one century kind
You're lighting fast
Built for speed
A tight lipped modern mind
An architect
Of grand romance
You're a mystery of disguise
You're holed up in your house
Just waiting for the fire
You're buttoned down
All sown up
You're an ontological soul
Cold hard truth
Only proof
What we already know

You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord

Look at us fools
Being used
We're totally dumb, surprised
Waiting for you to share with us
The myth behind the lies
Come on out
Throw us a bone
We want to know your intentions
Are you fake
For goodness sake
Or the mother of invention
You're buttoned down
All sown up
You're an ontological soul
Cold hard truth
Only proof
What we already know

You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord

You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord


When the shades are drawn
And the light of the moon is banned
And the stars up above
Walk the heavens hand in hand
There's a shady place
At the end of the working day
Where young lovers go
And this hot little trio plays

That's where we meet
That's where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street
Oh, where we meet
Oh, where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

From the alleyways
Where the catwalks gently sway
You hear the sound of Otis
And the voice of Marvin Gaye
In this smoky room
There's a jukebox, plays all night
And we can dance real close
Beneath the pulse of a neon light

That's where we meet
That's where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street
Oh, where we meet
Oh, where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

There's a downtown smell of cooking
From the flame on an open grill
There's a sax and a big bass pumping
Lord, have mercy
Ooh, you can't sit still
Oh, you can't sit still

Oh, that's where we meet
That's where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street
Ooh, where we meet
Where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

Oh, oh, yeah
You can't stand still
Where we meet
In the club at the end of the street
You can't stand still
Where we meet
In the club at the end of the street
You can't stand still
Where we meet
At the club at the end of the street
Where we meet
Where we meet
At the club at the end of the street


You don't love him any more
He threw your rag doll out the door
I keep my distance, I held my breath
Love always ends up hanging by a thread

Love hurts so much
Love leaves a scar
'I don't love you' is like a stake
Being driven through your heart

But I don't care
I came back for you
Love is cruel, but I don't care
I wanted you, and I'm cold, cold, cold

You said don't cry to me
He said I'm a dead man if you leave
I have no feelings, I have no heart
Love always cuts out the warm and tender part

Love hurts so much
Love cuts so deep
It's a hot sweat and a cold shake
Like drowning in your sleep


We still sit at separate tables
And we sleep at different times
And the warm wind in the palm trees
Hasn't helped to change our minds

It was the lure of the tropics
That I thought might heal the scars
Of a love burned out by silence
In a marriage minus heart

And I call the kids on the telephone
Say there's something wrong out here
It's July but it's cold as Christmas
In the middle of the year

The temperature's up to ninety five
But there's a winter look in your mother's eyes
And to melt the tears there's a heat wave here
So how come it's cold as Christmas in the middle of the year

I dreamed of love in a better climate
And for what it's really worth
I put faith in the star we followed
To this Caribbean surf

But there's an icy fringe on everything
And I cannot find the lines
Where's the beauty in the beast we made
Why the frost in the summertime


Your life stepped lightly out our hands
When no one's looking out you understand
Your world was a wheel but the cog ceased to turn
The bottom fell out and our fingers got burned

And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground
Oh your black icy snare once cut down my friend
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to end

Every new version of the way of life
Leaves you reckless and searching for stars in the night
But whose kid are you when they finally decide
The lifestyle you led and the way that you died

But they're oh so simple, they're still trying to tell
The difference for you between heaven and hell
To glorify something, your legends are found
But all they bought you was a hole in the ground

Years rolling by just like a dream
I'm partly human and I'm partly machine
They've lost you and fate put your name on a stone
Perhaps now my friend they might leave you alone


If you want it, here it is, come and get it
Make your mind up fast
If you want it anytime, I can give it
But you better hurry 'cause it may not last

Did I hear you say that there must be a catch
Will you walk away from a fool and his money
If you want it here it is, come and get it
But you better hurry 'cause it's going fast

If you want it, here it is, come and get it
Make your mind up fast
If you want it anytime, I can give it
But you better hurry 'cause it may not last

Did I hear you say that there must be a catch
Will you walk away from a fool and his money, sonny
If you want it here it is, come and get it
But you better hurry 'cause it's going fast
You better hurry 'cause it's going fast
Fool and his money, sonny

If you want it here it is, come and get it
But you better hurry 'cause it's going fast
You better hurry 'cause it's going fast
You better hurry 'cause it's going fast


In the quiet silent seconds I, I turned off the light switch
And I, I came down to meet you in the half light the moon left
While a, a cluster of night jars sang some songs out of tune
A mantle of bright light shone down from a room

Come down in time I still hear her say
So clear in my ear like it was today
Come down in time was the message she gave
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way

Well I don't know if I should have heard her as yet
But a, a true love like hers is a, a hard love to get
And I've, I've walked most all the way and I, I ain't heard her call
And I, I'm getting to thinking if she's coming at all

Come down in time I still hear her say
So clear in my ear like it was today
Come down in time was the message she gave
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way

There are women, women, and some hold you tight
While some leave you counting the stars in the night


When I was a little bitty baby
My Momma done rocked me in the cradle
In them old cottonfields back home

It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cottonfields back home

Let me tell you now well I got me in a mess
I caught a nail in my tire doing lickety splits
I had to walk a long long way to town

Came along a nice old man
Well he had a hammer
Wait a minute mister, can you get me some direction
I'm gonna wanna be right off for home

Oh, let them cotton balls get rotten
I got you baby, who needs cotton
In them old cottonfields back home

Well, it sure feels good to breathe the air back home
You should have seen their faces when they seen how I'd grown
In them old cotton fields back home



Soon the pines will be falling everywhere
Village children fight each other for a share
And the 6:09 goes roaring past the creek
Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week

I saw grandma yesterday down at the store
Well she's really going fine for eighty four
Well she asked me if sometime I'd fix her barn
Poor old girl she needs a hand to run the farm

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going home

Down at the well they've got a new machine
The foreman says it cuts man-power by fifteen
Yeah but that ain't natural well so old Clay would say
You see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going back home

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going back home

Now the old fat goose is flying 'cross the sticks
The hedgehog's done in clay between the bricks
And the rocking chair's creaking on the porch
Across the valley moves the herdsman with his torch

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going home, ooh
Country comfort's in a truck that's going back home
Yes it is
Country comfort in a truck that's going back home


Suzie walks her dog but it don't solve
All the mysteries
Hanging with the guys, making with the guys
Playing hard to please

Back in '63, she was made for me
We were having fun
Wasn't long before I could not ignore
She's about hanging out

Campus queen dreams
Shattered years ago
And I'm the one who knows

It's the same country love song
Different words, a different melody
It's the same country love song

Mama said to me, "John, you got to be
Honest to yourself
Keeping up the pace, losing in the race
Further on the shelf"

I want to write a country love song
Tell them nothing's wrong
Suzie did my heart

There is nothing more, something said before
See'est la vie, mon cherie
Lady Luck, me and sexy so and so
And I'm the one who knows


On a bench, on the beach
Just before the sun had gone
I tried to reach you
Plain faced and falling fast
You looked so vacant like an empty shell
Whose life had passed upon the ocean

Before light shook the sky
Down by the docks I saw
The masts unfolding
Don't turn away, please understand
It's a life and a living
And a way to keep the wolves away
From hungry hands, from hungry hands

Crazy water
Takes my fishing boat on Monday morning
Dangerous dreaming
If we all believe in the things you believe you're seeing
Oh we'd never drop our nets in the crazy water, crazy water

Tangled lives, lonely wives
Shoreline widows pray
For the souls of missing whalers
Endless nights on an endless sea
Where nothing lives between us
Just the breakers on the ocean
Separating you and me
Separating you and me


I remember when rock was young
Me and Suzie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh Lawdy mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

La lalalala la lalalala la lalalala la

But the years went by and the rock just died
Suzie went and left us for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
But they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last

Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh Lawdy mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

La lalalala la lalalala la lalalala la

I remember when rock was young
Me and Suzie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold Chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were Rocking Round the Clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Well Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will
Oh Lawdy mama those Friday nights
When Suzie wore her dresses tight
And the Crocodile Rocking was out of sight

La lalalala la lalalala la lalalala la
La lalalala la lalalala la lalalala la
La lalalala la lalalala la lalalala la


I found a black beret on the street today
It was lying in the gutter all torn
There's a white flag flying on a tall building
But the kids just watch the storm

Their dirty faces pressed on the windows
Shattered glass before their eyes
There's a mad dog barking in a burned out subway
Where the sniper sleeps at night

No birthday songs to sing again
Just bricks and stones to give them
Wrap them up in your father's flags
And let them cry to heaven

There are many graves by a cold lake
As the beds were when your babies are born
And your rag doll sits with a permanent grin
But the kids just watch the storm

I saw a black cat tease a white mouse
Until he killed it with his claws
Seems a lot of countries do the same thing
Before they go to war


We're caught up in a web, you and I
Since Crystal came between us
The knots of friendship seem to be untied
And it hurts me most to cheat and that's no lie
She can swing us both forever
In the long run she's the one who must decide

And if she leaves me handle her with care
Don't hurt little Crystal
And if she calls you long distance just be there
Oh Crystal
The world is your oyster, you're a pearl
But he's a jewel and my friend
I'm sure that in the end, Crystal you'll be his little girl
Oh Crystal

You're stronger than me but I'm sure
That the fight would fall to no one
The cold hard truth is stronger than us all
And it breaks my heart to see us go this far
We're just captives in our separate cells
And without her there's no peace behind these bars


I used to know this old scarecrow
He was my song
My joy and sorrow
Cast alone between the furrows
Of a field no longer sown by anyone
I held a dandelion
That said the time had come
To leave upon the wind
Not to return
When summer burned the earth again

Oh
Oh
Cultivate the freshest flower
This garden ever grew
Beneath these branches
I once wrote
Such childish words for you
But that's okay
There's treasure children always seek to find
And just like us
You must have had
A once-a-upon-a-time

Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh (lovely-lovely)
Oh (lovely-lovely)
Oh (lovely-lovely)
Oh (lovely-lovely)
Oh (lovely-lovely)
Oh (lovely-lovely)
Oh (lovely-lovely)
Oh (lovely-lovely)
Oh (lovely-lovely)
Oh (lovely-lovely)
Oh (lovely-lovely)
Oh (lovely-lovely)
Oh (lovely-lovely)
Oh (lovely-lovely)
Oh (lovely-lovely)
Oh (lovely-lovely)
Oh (lovely-lovely)
Oh (lovely-lovely)


Can you tell me how old Dan might have done it
If he'd been here now, holy cow
My stars might have been read on the planet Mars
Because I don't have foresight to see
If we still be together in the twenty first
In the twenty first century

He's our flying ace, pilot of the future
In an endless space, holy cow
My eyes never saw a rocket that was quite that size
Because I don't have the energy
To be cat and mouse for the champions
For the champions of destiny

So long captain Dan
I fail to see what motivates your hands
Goodbye restless night
You know I loved Dan Dare, but I couldn't make his flight
So long, so long

Dan Dare doesn't know it
He doesn't know it
He doesn't know it
But I liked the Meko


Have you ever had a good time turn bad
When the leaves turn brown
And the shattered glass just splinters

It's days like this that you can't resist
A long tall drink
And a big yellow sun in the winter

And you can go dancing
You can go dancing
You can go dancing
Dancing in the end zone

And you can go dancing
You can go dancing
You can go dancing
Dancing in the end zone

Did you ever pray you could stay away
Company excluded
From the curse of the family circle

In a big round room on the edge of the moon
There's a shooting star
In a race for the final hurdle

You can go dancing
You can go dancing
You can go dancing
Dancing in the end zone

And you can go dancing
You can go dancing
You can go dancing
Dancing in the end zone

No need to worry, no need to worry
No need to worry when you dance alone
You already made it, you already made it
When you're dancing in the end zone

You can go dancing
You can go dancing
You can go dancing
Dancing in the end zone

You can go dancing
You can go dancing
You can go dancing
Dancing in the end zone

You can go dancing
In the end zone
You can go dancing
In the end zone

You can go dancing
You can go dancing in the end zone
You can go dancing
You can go dancing in the end zone

You can go dancing
You can go dancing in the end zone



Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain
Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye
God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes

They say Spain is pretty, though I've never been
Well Daniel says it's the best place that he's ever seen
Oh and he should know, he's been there enough
Lord I miss Daniel, oh I miss him so much

Oh oh, Daniel my brother you are older than me
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
Your eyes have died, but you see more than I
Daniel you're a star in the face of the sky

Oh oh, Daniel my brother you are older than me
Do you still feel the pain of the scars that won't heal?
Your eyes have died, but you see more than I
Daniel you're a star in the face of the sky

Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane
I can see the red tail lights heading for Spain
Oh and I can see Daniel waving goodbye
God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes
Oh God it looks like Daniel, must be the clouds in my eyes


Oh, I'm a dark diamond
I've turned hard and cold
Once was a jewel with fire in my soul
There's two sides of a mirror
One I couldn't break through
Stayed trapped on the inside, wound up losing you

Tell me how does it work
How do you make things fit
Spent all my life trying to get it right
I've put it together and it falls apart
I thought to myself I might understand
But when the wall's built
And the heart hardens
You get a dark diamond
Dark diamond

Oh, I'm a dark diamond
But you're something else
You read me more than I read myself
The one star I could count on
Only comet I could trust
You burnt through my life to the true meaning of love


Dear God, are you there
Can you hear me, do you care
Dear God, here are we
Less than perfect, far from free

Oh we take what we get and we don't take no more
But we sometimes forget what it was you created us for

Dear God, now's the time
If you're listening, show some sign
Dear God, hear me plead
Don't desert us in our need

Dear God, lend a hand
Is this really what you planned
Dear God, in you we trust
Though we've failed you, don't fail us

Oh we take what we get but we can't take much more
Do you sometimes forget what it was you created us for, dear God

I hope and pray you'll lead us to a brighter day
Out of the darkness and light up our way, dear God
I hope and pray you'll lead us to a better way
Love is the answer so light up our way, dear God
Light up our way dear God, dear God
Love is the answer so light up our way, dear God


I got home today
Took a look around
Trying to find that girl of mine
She could not be found

All her things were gone
She just left a note
It don't take no mastermind
To figure what she wrote

And she said
"Dear John, I'm moving on;
By this time I'm gonna be long gone.
Dear John, c'est la vie.
Dear John, so long;
You've seen the last of me."

I don't want her back
I won't even try
This time ain't just au revoir
This time it's goodbye

We could not go on
Living like we were
I was just about to write
A Dear John note to her

I was gonna say
"Dear John, I'm moving on;
By this time I'm gonna be long gone.
Dear John, c'est la vie.
Dear John, so long;
You've seen the last of me."


The problem is
For many years
I've lived my life
Publicly
So it's hard for me to find a man I trust
I really trust
And everytime I find someone I like
Gotta worry about
If it's really me
That they see
And I thought you were the one, yeah

Deep inside I wish that they could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary
Deep inside I wish that they could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary

I don't have a lot of friends
And sometimes I have to wonder
Is it cash they see when they look at me
'Cause they're lookin' for a ride that's free
So I made the choice to be
Good to those who are good to me
Don't judge me, don't think I'm bitter
For the evil does allow me to see I'm just Mary

I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
I, I, oh

Deep inside I wish that they could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary
Deep inside I wish that they could see
That I'm just plain ol' Mary, Mary

The problem is
For many years
I've lived my life
Publicly
And everytime I find a man
I, I can't trust him
Oh


Sling your hook in with him baby
He's a real sharp-shooter now
If he's out there hiding in the tall grass
Tell him I said he was a coward

This ain't any old western honey
It's the twentieth century now
But if he thinks he's some kind of tough cowboy
And he's hurt her then I want to know how

Did he shoot her with his compromise
Like a heart attack he can paralyze
Or did he hang her in a noose
On the telephone line

Did he shoot her with a forty five
Did he leave his mark right between her eyes
Oh did he shoot that girl
That used to be mine

Tell him I'm ready any time he chooses
The pay-off for the things, for the things he's done
He ain't messing with no two-bit bandit
Armed with a couple of guns

If he wants to see it as a two reel movie
He's living in the head of someone else
But better take him down and dust him honey
I want to hear the truth for myself

Did he shoot her
Did he shoot her


I've seen a lot of women who haven't had much luck
I've seen you looking like you've been run down by a truck
That ain't nice to say, sometimes I guess I'm really hard
But I'm gonna put buckshot in your pants if you step into my yard

When I watch the police come by and move you on
Well, I sometimes wonder what's beneath the mess you've become
Well, you may have been a pioneer in the trade of women's wear
But all you got was a mop-up job washing other people's stairs

How she do it, how she do it, how she do it, oh
I'm gonna tell the world, you're a dirty little girl
Someone grab that bitch by the ears
Rub her down, scrub her back
Turn her inside out
'Cause I bet she, I bet she
I bet she
Oh, I bet she hasn't had a bath in years

Here's my own belief about all the dirty girls
That you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl
And like rags that belong to you I belong to myself
So don't show up around here till your social worker's helped

How she do it, how she do it, how she do it, oh
I'm gonna tell the world, you're a dirty little girl
Someone grab that bitch by the ears
Rub her down, scrub her back
Turn her inside out
'Cause I bet she, oh, I bet she
Let me tell you now, I bet she
Oh, I bet she hasn't had a bath in years

Oh, oh
Ah, ah
Yes, I bet she, oh, I bet she
Oh, now, I bet she, yeah I bet she
Oh, I bet she hasn't had a bath in years


Showboat coming up the river
See her lanterns flicker in the gentle breeze
I can hear the crickets singing in the evening
Old Dixie Lily moving past the cypress trees

My little boat - she rocks easy
I've been catching catfish in the creek all day
Oh, and I've never seen ladies like those on the big boats
Must be fancy breeding lets you live that way

Dixie Lily, chugging like a grand old lady
Paddles hitting home in the noonday sun
Plowing through the water with your whistles blowing
Down from Louisiana on the Vicksburg run

Papa says that I'm a dreamer
Says them 'squitas bit me one too many times
Oh, but I never get lonesome living on the river
Watching old Lily leave the world behind


Don't go breaking my heart
I couldn't if I tried
Honey if I get restless
Baby you're not that kind

Don't go breaking my heart
You take the weight off me
Honey when you knock on my door
I gave you my key

Nobody knows it
When I was down
I was your clown
Nobody knows it
Right from the start
I gave you my heart
I gave you my heart

So don't go breaking my heart
I won't go breaking your heart
Don't go breaking my heart

And nobody told us
'Cause nobody showed us
And now it's up to us babe
I think we can make it

So don't misunderstand me
You put the light in my life
You put the sparks to the flame
I've got your heart in my sights


I can't light no more of your darkness
All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life

It's much too late to save myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
But losing everything is like the sun going down on me

Ladies and gentlemen Mr. Elton John
I can't find
Oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way feel
Don't discard me baby don't
Just because you think I mean you harm
Just because you think I mean you harm, oh
But these cuts I have, cuts I have
They need love
They need love, they need love to help them heal

Oh, don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
Cause' losing everything is like the sun going down on me

Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I that see, yeah
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free baby, oh
'Cause' losing everything is like the sun going down on me


If you wake up and don't want to smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You'll see things in a different way

Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here, better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Why not think about the times to come
And not about the things that you've done
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do

All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you don't believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you

Don't you look back
Don't you look back


She's a real ball-buster, don't trust her,
She's in a most peculiar phase.
You can rear end her, oh, it'll send her.
She wants you, she'll have you her own way.

Don't untie her, don't defy her,
'Cause she'll bring you down to your knees.
You can beat her but don't mistreat her,
Oh, don't believe that woman please.

Don't trust that woman,
Don't trust that woman, boys,
'Cause she'll burn you,
Turn you into little toys.
Don't trust that woman,
Don't trust that woman, boys,
'Cause she'll hurt you,
And turn you into little toys.
Don't trust that woman, boys.

She's a man-eater, oh, don't you cheat her;
She'll cut you, just to watch you bleed.
A woman half crazy, oh, then again lazy,
With an appetite to feed.

She's a liar, oh, you can't buy her,
'Cause she'll bring you down to your knees.
Don't untie her, don't defy her,
Oh, don't believe that woman please.

Mean sister, tongue-twister,
She takes it easy, but she makes it hard.
Soul sister, two-fister,
She takes it easy, but she makes it hard.


We're no handy silver lining
We're no crime to make the headline news
If it's a matter for decision
You and I can be the ones to choose

Je te donne mes espoirs cach's
Je te donne me incertitudes
Je te donne mes plus grands secrets
La vie c'est d'j' si compliqu'

Donner pour donner
Tout donner
C'est la seule fa'on d'aimer
Donner pour donner
C'est la seule fa'on de vivre
C'est la seule fa'on d'aimer

Pas la peine de vivre enferm'
C'est pas la peine
Pas la peine de rester couch'
Non, c'est pas la peine
Je te donne sans rien demander
La vie c'est d'j' si compliqu'

Je te donne mes sourires moqueurs
Je te donne ma force, ma douceur
Je te donne mes secrets fragiles
La vie c'est d'j' si difficile

Donner pour donner
Tout donner
C'est la seule fa'on d'aimer
Donner pour donner
C'est la seule fa'on de vivre
C'est la seule fa'on d'aimer

Oh, donner pour donner
Tout donner
C'est la seule fa'on d'aimer
Donner pour donner
C'est la seule fa'on de vivre
C'est la seule fa'on d'aimer

Oh, donner pour donner
Tout donner
C'est la seule fa'on d'aimer
Donner pour donner
C'est la seule fa'on de vivre
C'est la seule fa'on d'aimer

We are currently missing these lyrics.


Look at you, could I have been so foolish and so green
A face that smiled at every passing scene
Look at you, you're lost behind the web of woven time
When each emotion pinball in your mind

Look at me, I'm happy now I see your face and smile
I was the judge and jury at your trial
Look at me, you know the road ahead will twist and turn
Now I have the time to stand and learn

But you and I have come so far
With a shaken faith
From the pain of a broken heart
Toward feeling great
Feel like life has just begun
No more singing duets for one

I hold your picture here beside the bed
You had a party raging in your head
Look at me, I look at you with vacancy and hurt
And here today all I can do is learn

Look at me, I'm happy now I see your face and smile
I was the judge and jury at your trial
Look at me, you know the road ahead will twist and turn
Now I have the time to stand and learn

I have this picture of me looking at you
Looking at me
And I would like to say
Goodbye, sweet memory


I won't see you `till Christmas
I breathe coal dust, I get blisters
But the foreman he don't worry
He say work boy there's no hurry
Don't that big red sun
Look a lot like fire
When you come out of the ground
After forty eight hours

Going down down down down down
Going down in Durban deep
Going down down down down down
There's no mercy in my sleep
I just hear that drill and hammer
I feel the killing heat
Going two miles down to the heart
Of Durban deep

I was born on amen corner
I pound rock face, I get lonely
But my family they go hungry
Sill the boss man he call us lazy
Don't the old blue heaven
Look a lot like your eyes
When you're blinded by the brightness
Of the Transvaal sky


[Instrumental]


Every time you turn around
You wear another face
Every time i look away
I find a hiding place

If you knew me like you knew him
You would know just how i feel
Slipping through someone's fingers
Falling under someone's wheels

It's easier to walk away
Better off to face the facts
When love holds you up for ransom
Walk away and don't look back

Never seen you looking back through
Smiling eyes and tears
Never knew you holding on to
Memories and fears

Just release me i can't take it
Can't you see a change has come
Strangled by infatuation
Buried under someone's thumb

It's easier to walk away
Cover and fade to black
When love scars and leaves you branded
Walk away and don't look back

Every time you turn around
You wear another face
Every time i look away
I find a hiding place


Take a look at me now
And take a taste of the money
I'm not in it for the bread
I'm in it for the gravy honey

Step on the thin ice lightly
And check out the show twice nightly
Oh cause I'm, I'm on the stage tonight
And if the price is right 

I'll, I will amaze before the light
I crave the light mmm blinding white
I need the light tonight

Take a look at me now 
And take a look at my billing
I'm not in it as an extra 
I'm in it for the killing

Inflate my ego gently 
Tell them heaven sent me
Oh 'cause I'm, I'm so expressive 
And I'm so obsessed 

With my ego, my ego 
And it's message oo inform the press
Invite the guests I need the press tonight

Do you remember acting out your youth
A romeo resplendent on an orange case
Do you remember how I would recite 
And how I'd blow my lines

And hide my face
Well maybe it was childish,  foolish 
Before schoolish, immaturish, lose your coolish
Well I had to grow and prove my ego

Take a look at me now
And take a taste of the money 
I'm not in it for the bread
I'm in it for the gravy honey 

Inflate my ego gently 
Go tell them heaven sent me
Oh cause I'm, I'm so expressive 
And I'm so obsessed 

With my ego, my ego
And it's message oo inform the press
invite the guests I need the press tonight

Do you remember how I would recite 
And how I'd blow my lines
And hide my face
Well maybe it was childish,  foolish 
Before schoolish, immaturish, lose your coolish
Well I had to grow and prove my ego


You had your grand illusion and wrestled with your fate
The winter of your discontent came twenty years too late
If it was love and I was there I've forgotten where it lives
We both stepped off a frozen rock onto a burning bridge
You came like an invasion all bells and whistles blowing
Reaping the rewards of the fable you'd been sowing
I saw you cross the landing and descending marble stairs
Like Caesar crossed the Rubicon you seemed to walk on air

And yeah I've seen your movie
And I read it in your book
The truth just flew off every page
Your songs have all the hooks
You're seven wonders rolled in one
You shifted gear to cruise
Oh you came to town in headlines
And eight hundred dollar shoes

Oh the bellboys are crying and moneys changing hands
Your cloak and dagger legacy's gone home to no man's land
The marquee lights are flickering your poster's fading fast
Your being here just melts away like ice cubes in a glass

And yeah I've seen your movie
And I read it in your book
The truth just flew off every page
Your songs have all the hooks
You're seven wonders rolled in one
You shifted gear to cruise
Oh you came to town in headlines
And eight hundred dollar shoes

Oh you came to town in headlines
And eight hundred dollar shoes


Our glorious city
Was build by the divinities by Gods
Who saw fit to bestow
The gift of a pardise
Peaceful and harmonious upon
Us mere mortals below

And made El Dorado
The magnificent and golden
One thousand years ago
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado

But all this was granted
For only one millennium
I know my legacy is to fulfill
My promise to all my people
Who have trusted me, the Gods
Will approve of us still

Preserve El Dorado
The magnificent and golden
And I believe they will

El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado

The mountains so high and waters deep
Are her disguise
Her secrets are safe from foreign hands
And eyes forever

Preserve El Dorado
The magnificent and goldent
And I believe they will

El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado

El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado




There's a fly in the window
A dog in the yard
And a year since I saw you
There's a trunk in the corner
I keep all my letters
My bills and demands I keep too

Well I can't help thinking
About the times
You were a wife of mine
You aimed to please me
Cooked black-eyed peas-me
Made elderberry wine

Drunk all the time
Feeling fine on elderberry wine
Those were the days
We'd lay in the haze
Forget depressive times
How can I ever get it together
Without a wife in line
To pick the crop and get me hot
On elderberry wine

Round a tee in the summer
A fire in the fall
Flat out when they couldn't stand
The bottle went round
Like a woman down south
Passed on from hand to hand

Well I can't help thinking
About the times
You were a wife of mine
You aimed to please me
Cooked black-eyed peas-me
Made elderberry wine

Drunk all the time
Feeling fine on elderberry wine
Those were the days
We'd lay in the haze
Forget depressive times
How can I ever get it together
Without a wife in line
To pick the crop and get me hot
On elderberry wine

Drunk all the time
Feeling fine on elderberry wine
Those were the days
We'd lay in the haze
Forget depressive times
How can I ever get it together
Without a wife in line
To pick the crop and get me hot
On elderberry wine

Elderberry wine
Elderberry wine
Elderberry wine
Elderberry wine
Elderberry wine
Elderberry wine
Elderberry wine
Elderberry wine
Elderberry wine


I can't really explain it
I haven't got the words
It's a feeling that you can't control
I suppose its like forgetting
Losing who you are
And at the same time
Something makes you whole
Its like that there's a music
Playing in your ear
And I'm listening, and I'm listening
And then I disappear

And then I feel a change
Like a fire deep inside
Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide

And suddenly I'm flying
Flying like a bird
Like electricity
Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free

It's a bit like being angry
It's a bit like being scared
Confused and all mixed up
And mad as hell
It's like when you've been crying
And you're empty, and you're full
I don't know what it is
It's hard to tell

Its like that there's some music
Playing in your ear
But the music
Is impossible
Impossible to hear

But then I feel it move me
Like a burning deep inside
Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide

Then suddenly I'm flying
Flying like a bird
Like electricity
Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free

Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free
Oh oh whoa
I'm free


Staring all alone
And your grace and style
Cut me to the bone
With your razor blade smile
I watched you playing pool
It's all around the school that I love you

I love your gypsy hair
And dark brown eyes
Always unprepared
For your pointed replies
Cynical and lean
I lie awake and dream about you

If you only knew
What I'm going through
Time and again I get ashamed
To say your name
It's hard to grin and bear
When you're standing there
My lips are dry
I catch your eye and look away

Sitting in my room
I've got it bad
Crying for the moon
They think I'm mad
They say it isn't real
But I know what I feel and I love you

But I would give my life
For a single night beside you


We are currently missing these lyrics.


The church bells ring out morning glory
When summer bends to the winter's rage
Emily walks through the cemetery
Passed a dog in an unmarked grave
The old girl hobbles, nylons sagging
Talks to her sisters in the ground
I saw a lie in the mirror this morning
I heard a prophesy all around

And Emily they come and go
The shadows and the distant sounds
But Emily don't be afraid
When the weight of angels weighs you down

Emily prays to a faded hero
In a little frame clutched to her gown
Hears the voice of promise in his memory
Tonight's the night they let the ladder down
In a cage sits a gold canary
By a wicker chair and a rosewood loom
As a soul ascends aboard the evening
Canary sings to an empty room

And Emily they come and go
The shadows and the distant sounds
But Emily don't be afraid
When the weight of angels weighs you down


What happened here
As the New York sunset disappeared
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there
Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain

And what's it for
This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk nothing grows no more
Who lived here
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed, we're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one no one can replace

And I've been knocking but no one answers
And I've been knocking most of the day
Oh and I've been calling, oh hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out to play

And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger, if only he could hear
Who lived there
He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name

And I've been knocking but no one answers
And I've been knocking most of the day
Oh and I've been calling, oh hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out to play

And I've been knocking but no one answers
And I've been knocking most all the day
Oh and I've been calling, oh hey hey Johnny
Can't you come out, can you come out to play, Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden, Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden, Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden, Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden, Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden, Johnny
Can't you come out to play in your empty garden, Johnny


I'm not a rat to be spat on locked up in this room
Those bars that look towards the sun at night look towards the moon
Everyday the swallows play in the clouds of love
Make me wish that I had wings take me high above

And I looked high and saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place

At night I lay upon my bench and stare towards the stars
The cold night air comes creeping in and home seems oh so far
If only I could swing upon those twinkling dots above
I'd look down from the heavens upon the ones I love

Hey the lucky locket hangs around your precious neck
Some luck I ever got with you and I wouldn't like to bet
That sooner or later you'll own just one half of this land
By shining your eyes on the wealth of every man

And I looked high and saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place

Just send up my love ain't seen nothing but tears
Now I've got myself in this room for years
I don't see no one, I never see anyone


Had some good times jumping ship
And showing up on shore
Just pocket change to get us by
A little bit of grease to help us slide
Give us a nickel and take your mark
To squeeze under the door

Caught some big ones
Reeled em in
And hung em out to dry
From little fish to bigger things
A welcome push
An empty swing
Given the chance we'd stop to sing
And watch the world go by

And I tried to take my time
To get back up, hold on and climb
Into the arms, you'll always find me
In England and America (England and America)
It seems good to hold, to not let go
The safety net still hangs real low
And if I fall it's good to know
There's England and America

Showed our roots from time to time
And used it to ignite
Our wilder side to get up through
To push and pull, and come unglued
Mixture of red wine and blues
That run right through our lives

And I tried to take my time
To get back up, hold on and climb
Into the arms, you'll always find me
In England and America (England and America)
It seems good to hold, to not let go
The safety net still hangs real low
And if I fall it's good to know
There's England and America

And I tried to take my time
To get back up, hold on and climb
Into the arms, you'll always find me
In England and America 
It seems good to hold, to not let go
The safety net still hangs real low
And if I fall it's good to know
There's England and America (England and America)

And I tried to take my time
To get back up, hold on and climb
Into the arms, you'll always find me
In England and America (England and America)
It seems good to hold, to not let go
The safety net still hangs real low
And if I fall it's good to know
There's England and America

England and America
England and America


How come you're so understanding
When I tell you all my lies
And pretending to believe them
See through all my alibis
And I need you more than ever
And I want you till the end
Chloe

How you handle what you live through
I can never hope to learn
Taking all the pain I give you
Loving blindly in return
And I need you more than ever
I will always be your friend
Chloe
Chloe

Chloe, what you gonna do about me
Chloe, what you gonna do
What you gonna do about me

You're the lifeline that I cling to
When I feel like givin' in
When the dreams that I rely on
Start to wear a little thin
Then I need you more than ever
And I want you till the end
Chloe
Chloe

Chloe, what you gonna do about me
Chloe, what you gonna do
What you gonna do about me

Then I need you more than ever
And I want you till the end
Chloe
Chloe

Chloe, what you gonna do about me
Chloe, what you gonna do
What you gonna do about me
What you gonna do about me


How come you're so understanding
When I tell you all my lies
And pretending to believe them
See through all my alibis
And I need you more than ever
And I want you 'til the end
Chloe

How you handle what you live through
I can never hope to learn
Taking all the pain I give you
Loving blindly in return
And I need you more than ever
I will always be your friend
Chloe
Chloe

Chloe, what you gonna do about me

One day you say you love me
The next you tell me you don't
One day you say you will
And the next you tell me you won't
Hey little baby
There ain't much point in hanging around (Yea)
One day you make me feel like your love is in my hands
One day you say you'll stay
The next you're changing your plans
Hey little baby
Ain't much point in hanging around (Yea)
Cause' if you ain't got time for me I'll find another fantasy

It is kind of funny that you think that
I am the boy to make you cry
I can make you happy
If only for a while
Little baby I can give you all the loving that your heart desires
If you ain't got time for me I'll find another fantasy

It could be the price of love
Could the price of hate
What am I guilty of
Why do you make me wait
So long I don't know your intentions
Look to the sky's above
I am in the hands of fate
Push till it gets to shove
I have got to know for heavens sake
Is this love or invention
Baby can't you see I'll find another fantasy

You hang around with people who are sure to make you cry
I can make you happy if only for a while
Little baby oh, oh little baby
I can give you all the lovin' that your heart desires
If you ain't got time for me I'll find another fantasy

You take someone's heart
And you kick it around
Keep on picking it up
So you can watch it come down
I don't know what I am suppose to do
Why I wait for you to make up your mind
Would you please be so kind
When you know what to do I'll be in the next room
But if you make it to late I may be in the next day
Hmm...


I read about how you're slow with the truth
Like any old Aesop's Fable
But when you're turtle-esque, I'm a hare's breath
Into payment under the table
But some journalist got his mug shot kit
And his briefcase on his lap
But I'm tired of being linked with the K.G.B.
And all that political crap

Cause I've seen your fascist faces
On the cover of the national papers
Staring out in black and white
From the tall gray walls on the other side
When I see your fascist faces
Then I know I've had enough
Trying to trace it or erase it
Is it foolproof or a bluff?

If the boy had been blessed, he'd have been arrested
On a charge of wearing red shoes
But if your pants are blue, you got nothing to lose
It'll make you a patriot through and through


Fat boys cry when ugly girls sing
About the way the world would be if they were thin
And ugly girls turn their heads when fat boys laugh
About the handsome kid next door who broke their heart
Who broke their heart
Broke their heart

And fat boys lie when ugly girls ask
About the size an apple pie looks through a magnifying glass
And ugly girls dream at night when fat boys sleep
About the way the mirrors lie when beauty's only skin deep
Beauty's only skin deep
Skin deep

But it's the fat boy's world for an ugly girl
And ugly girls love that fat boy joy
Who needs the worries of a perfect world
Hear the early birds make that spring time come
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl

Fat boys dance when ugly girls shout
That a waltz is not the dance for the boy who's stout
And ugly girls dream at night when fat boys sleep
About the way the mirrors lie when beauty's only skin deep
Beauty's only skin deep
Skin deep

But it's the fat boy's world for an ugly girl
And ugly girls love that fat boy joy
Who needs the worries of a perfect world
Hear the early birds make that spring time come
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl

But it's the fat boy's world for an ugly girl
And ugly girls love that fat boy joy
Who needs the worries of a perfect world
Hear the early birds make that spring time come
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl

Fat boys and ugly girls
I'm talking about fat boys and ugly girls
Fat, fat, fat boys and ugly girls
I'm talking about fat boys, fat boys and ugly girls



Don't close the shades
I'm scared of the darkness
I'm cold as a razor blade
Inches from madness

Don't let me sleep here
They're all trying to kill me
I've seen the walls moving
They've all heard me screaming, screaming

Feed me
Feed my needs and then just leave me
Let me go back where you found me
`Cause I miss my basement
The sweet smell of new paint
The warmth and the comforts of home
So feed me
Give me my treatment and free me
My arms are so hungry so feed me

The room's so distorted
And filled with mad shadows
I feel like a carcass
White like a marrow bone

It all seems so long ago
I remember them laughing
I heard the ambulance scream
I saw the red light flashing, flashing


I was one as you were one
And we were two so much in love forever
I loved the white socks that you wore
But you don't wear white socks no more; now you're a woman
I joked about your turned-up nose
And criticized your school-girl clothes
But would I then have paced these roads to love you
For seasons come and seasons go
Bring forth the rain the sun and snow
Make Valerie a woman
And Valerie is lonely

No more to roam on the snow hills of Hinton
Undecided with the guardians of the older generation
A doormat was a sign of welcome
In the winter months to come
And in the summer laughing
Through the castle ruins we'd run

For the quadrangle sang to the sun
And the grace of our feeling
And the candle burned low as we talked of the future
Underneath the ceiling
There were tears in the sky
And the clouds in your eyes were just cover
For your thighs were the cushions
Of my love and yours for each other
The songs still are sung
It was fun to be young
But please, don't be sad where 'ere you are

I am who I am
You are who you are
Now Valerie's a woman
Now Valerie's a woman
Now Valerie's a woman


You're walking, talking like a flame, baby
You're walking, talking like a flame, baby

Never knew what my heart would be facing
Guess I must have been blind saying goodbye yo you, baby
Close my eyes at night I can taste it
I'm running back in the fire where I once had you, baby

You said don't ever leave me
But I say that's something I won't ever do

I want you back in my arms
In the flames of paradise
In the flames of paradise
I want you back in my arms
In the flames of paradise
The flames of paradise

I give all of my love just to you
It's been so long baby
I give you all my love waits for you
Don't take too long baby

I've been making some brave conversation
Telling friends I'm way better off without you
Then I was living in my imagination
Thinking I could make it without you too baby

My heart tried to deceive me
But that's one thing it just can't do

You said don't ever leave me
Oh that's one thing I won't ever do

Oh, yeah, oh, yeah


This was an instrumental piece composed by orchestral string arranger/composer Paul Buckmaster and has no lyrics . It featured on the 1971 album Friends soundtrack that also had five Elton John songs on it, but it is not an Elton John song.






Me and you we're not that pretty
Me and you could use a lift
I'm out here on the corner crying
I got ribbons but I got no gift

Me and you we're all we've got
Me and you could be our curse
We've got bleeding hearts and flowers
You got strings but you got no purse

We're just freaks in love
Saints above
Shine on our sweet life
Happy is the union
Of fools and freaks alike

And fearless are the idiots
Among the hawks and doves
We're on the outside looking in
A couple of freaks in love

There's a wonder in this weakness
It's so beautiful sometimes
Across the universe we're lightning
In the race we're a step behind

Me and you we're not for everyone
Me and you we're damaged goods
We're antique and unacceptable
And just misunderstood

We're just freaks in love
Saints above
Shine on our sweet life
Happy is the union
Of fools and freaks alike

And fearless are the idiots
Among the hawks and doves
We're on the outside looking in
A couple of freaks in love

We're just freaks in love
Saints above
Shine on our sweet life
Happy is the union
Of fools and freaks alike

And fearless are the idiots
Among the hawks and doves
We're on the outside looking in
A couple of freaks in love

We're on the outside looking in
A couple of freaks in love


I've got a strong-willed someone to love me
Here off a highway in the way
Don't need to shout it
We're living here quietly
Away from the folks
Who just sleep all day
I lived the fast life, taking some chances
On my high horse everyone rode
All around were too many monkeys
Asleep at the wheel
And running the show

But I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
Rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight

All my sweet sins stayed in the city
I caved in and wandered into your heart
When least expected out of the heavens
The moonlight descended into the dark

But I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
I'm rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight

Was your bloom just what to watch
In no heaven
Set back the clock you gave me
Your time
I'm living better now I'm free and easy
Freedom past I've left here high

Well I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
Rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Because I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
Rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight


I won't let you down
I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got
I won't let you down
So please don't give me up
'Cause I would really, really love to stick around, oh yeah

Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be (Didn't know what I wanted to be)
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me (said I guess it was enough for me)
To win the race? A prettier face!
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll T.V.
But today the way I play the game is not the same, no way
Think I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I told you so
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone else I've got to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Take back your singing in the rain
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me yeah yeah

Freedom! (I won't let you down)
Freedom! (I will not give you up)
Freedom! (Have some faith in the sound)
You've gotta give for what you take (It's the one good thing that I've got)
Freedom! (I won't let you down)
Freedom! (So please don't give me up)
Freedom! ('Cause I would really, really love to stick around)
You've gotta give for what you take

Heaven knows we sure had some fun, boy
What a kick just a buddy and me (what a kick just a buddy and me)
We had every big-shot good time band on the run, boy
We were living in a fantasy (we were living in a fantasy)
We won the race, got out of the place
I went back home, got a brand new face
For the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change, oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get myself happy

I think there's something you should know
I think it's time I stopped the show
There's something deep inside of me
There's someone I forgot to be
Take back your picture in a frame
Don't think that I'll be back again
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me, yeah yeah

Freedom! (I won't let you down)
Freedom! (I will not give you up)
Freedom! (Have some faith in the sound)
You've gotta give for what you take (It's the one good thing that I've got)
Freedom! (I won't let you down)
Freedom! (So please don't give me up)
Freedom! ('Cause I would really, really love to stick around)
You've gotta give for what you take

Well it looks like the road to heaven
But it feels like the road to hell
When I knew which side my bread was buttered
I took the knife as well
Posing for another picture
Everybody's got to sell
But when you shake your ass
They notice fast
And some mistakes were build to last

That's what you get (That's what you get)
That's what you get (I say that's what you get)
That's what you get (for changing your mind)
That's what you get for changing your mind

That's what you get
That's what you get (And after all this time)
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make me, oh yeah

All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me, yeah yeah

Freedom! 
Freedom! (oh freedom)
Freedom! (my freedom)
You've gotta give for what you take 
Freedom! (hold on to my freedom)
Freedom! 
Freedom! (my freedom)
You've gotta give for what you take
Give for what you, give for what you take yeah
Yeah, you've got to give for what you, give for what you, give

May not be what you want from me
Just the way it's got to be
Lose the face now
I've got to live, I've got to live, I've got to live


I hope the day will be a lighter highway
For friends are found on every road
Can you ever think of any better way
For the lost and weary travelers to go?

Making friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light
If your friends are there, then everything's all right

It seems to me a crime that we should age
These fragile times should never slip us by
A time you never can or shall erase
As friends together watch their childhood fly


There isn't much I haven't shared
With you along the road
And through it all there'd always be
Tomorrow's episode

Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning the great divide
Ask no questions, take no side

Who's to say who's right or wrong
Whose course is braver run
Still we are, have always been
Will ever be as one

What is done has been done for the best
Though the mist in my eyes might suggest
Just a little confusion about what I'll lose
But if I started over I know I would choose

The same joy the same sadness each step of the way
That fought me and tought me that friends never say

Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye

Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning, the great divide
I would choose
The same joy the same sadness each step of the way
That fought me and taught me that friends never say

Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye


If I say goodbye it'll grieve you
Denver means the whole world to you
Girl it breaks me up just to leave you
But I got things that I got to do

Got to take my guitar
With one break I'm a star
Girl I'll love you forever more
But today I've got to make my way
From Denver to L.A.

Girl I know that you'll make me stay
But today I've got to make my way
From Denver to L.A.

There's a whole new life to be led there
That's the place that I got to be
Guys are making mountains of bread there
Reckon it could happen to me

Lots of guys make the grade
Just one break and I may
And I'll bring it on home


The roses in the window box
Have tilted to one side
Everything about this house
Was born to grow and die

Oh it doesn't seem a year ago
To this very day
You said I'm sorry honey
If I don't change the pace
I can't face another day

And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you
So I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

I wonder if those changes
Have left a scar on you
Like all the burning hoops of fire
That you and I passed through

You're a bluebird on a telegraph line
I hope you're happy now
Well if the wind of change comes down your way girl
You'll make it back somehow

And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you
So I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

And love lies bleeding in my hand
Oh it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playing rock and roll and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you
So I split the band
Love lies bleeding in my hands

Love lies bleeding in my hand


When it's springtime down in Georgia
It's winter time up in Maine
You can go from snow to sunshine
If you board a southbound train
You get used to taking orders
But it's sometimes kind of rough
I got everything that a man could need
But it still ain't quite enough

Taking about oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
I sometimes feel my life is rolling on
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
I need to see them one more time before I'm gone

When it's nighttime down in Georgia
It's daytime in L.A.
Where they never seem to do much
But they sure got lots to say
The times are changing down in Georgia
Though not always for the best
Give me thirty five good acres lord
And let progress take the rest

Talking about oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
I sometimes feel that life is rolling on
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
I need to see them one more time before they're gone

Oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
I sometimes feel that life has passed me by
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
I need to see them one more time before I die

Uh..
Hit 'em with a little ghetto gospel

Those who wish to follow me (My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks
At last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sounds of guns

If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit and reminisce thinkin' of bliss of the good days
I stop and stare at the younger; my heart goes to 'em
AIDS tested, it was stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth, 'cause the truth look strange
And for me it's reversed, we left them a world that's cursed and it hurts
Cause any day they'll push the button
And all commend, like Malcolm X and Bobby Hut died for nothin'
Thought'll make you get teary, the world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, 'cause we're human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined
My Ghetto Gospel

Those who wish to follow me (My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks
At last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sounds of guns

Tell me do you see that old lady, ain't it sad?
Livin' outta bags, but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady
Crack got her crazy, yet she's givin' birth to a baby
I don't trip or let it fade me
From outta the frying pan we jumpin' to another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I say go, stay in control, drink out my own bottles
I made mistakes but learned from every one
And when it's said and done
I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you don't stress
Never forget, that God hasn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy?
Cause I chose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets
My Ghetto Gospel

Those who wish to follow me (My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks
At last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sounds of guns

Lord can you hear me speak?

They pay the price for being hell bound


You've been crying, and I'm crazy about you
I've been lying, and hanging you up, `cause
I'm deep on the inside, but flash on the outside
I am the thunder, and you are my lightning

Give me the love, baby, give me the key to your heart
Give me the love, baby, give me the key to your heart
Give me the love, give me the key to your heart

Months of watching, and hours of hoping
That you'd want me, when you see me again
For I am an eagle, but my wings are all tied up
You got the power to fly me again

You've been trying to build walls all around you
But you're lying, `cause I've already been through
And I've seen you trying to capture that feeling
But you're chasing what you've never believed in

Tell me you love me, tell me you need me

It's so hard to say goodbye
When there's nothing left to give
When this house is just a hill of bones
Where you and I once lived

If we put it back together
By the skin of our teeth
You'd still pull it all apart
Bit by bit, piece by piece

And I'll go it alone, call this house my home
Build it up again with someone new
Build it brick by brick, till I find a girl that fits
This home's a whole lot better without you

There's no passion alive
When you count your phony schemes
And the cars you drive to buy your friends
They don't ever come back clean

If the cards on the table
Always turn up spades
The cards that always cheat the hearts
The spades you play just dug my grave

And I'll go it alone, call this house my home
Build it up again with someone new
Build it brick by brick, till I find a girl that fits
This home's a whole lot better without you

And I'll go it alone, call this house my home
I'm gonna build it up again with someone new
Build it brick by brick, till I find a girl that fits
This home's a whole lot better without you

Oh, I'll go it alone, call this house my home
Build it up again with someone new
I'll build it brick by brick, till I find a girl that fits
This home's a whole lot better without you

Without you
Without you

Without you
Without you

Without you
Without you

Luther left us first light Friday morning
Little Dan and Becky waved goodbye
They're gonna have to share the weight together
Idle hands will see a good farm slowly die

Gone to Shiloh
For the Union
Shoulder to shoulder
Side by side
Gone to Shiloh
Hope springs eternal
When flags and bullets start to fly

April's come and the air smells fresh with rain
They watched his shadow fade around the bend
He's headed for a different kind of thunder
And the stunned surprise in the eyes of dying men

Gone to Shiloh
For the Union
Shoulder to shoulder
Side by side
Gone to Shiloh
Time passes slowly
When flags and bullets start to fly

The old black rooster sang him down that dirt road
His step seemed bold, his manner fancy-free
I pray we see him alive and well in the fall here
Than that God-forsaken place in Tennessee

Gone to Shiloh
For the Union
Shoulder to shoulder
Side by side
Gone to Shiloh
Men stand united
When flags and bullets start to fly

After all of this
If we should prevail
Heaven help the South
When Sherman comes their way


Good morning world, it's a brand new day
I'm packing my bags and I'm going away
I'm moving my legs and my city tired bones
I gotta get away from the busy man's phones

Gotta make a move where the living is wild and free
If you want to get happy them people come along with me
A fee fa fou fafafafa fouu

Run along boy, set a place for me
I'm getting so tired of the company
I'm getting dirty looks from the big white man
I gotta get away just as fast as I can

Good morning freedom
Gotta break away
Gotta break away
Gotta break away
Good morning freedom
It's another day
It's another day
It's another day
Good morning freedom
A fee fa fou fafafafa fouu

It is the same old game
A city tired living is the game to play
Loving thy neighbour is __
There's only one way to get the people to sing


And now that it's all over
The birds can nest again
I'll only snow when the sun comes out
I'll shine only when it starts to rain

And if you want a drink
Just squeeze my hand
And wine will flow into the land
And feed my lambs

For I am a mirror
I can reflect the moon
I will write songs for you
I'll be your silver spoon

I'm sorry I took your time
I am the poem that doesn't rhyme
Just turn back a page
I'll waste away, I'll waste away
I'll waste away, I'll waste away
I'll waste away, I'll waste away


Say goodbye to loneliness, say goodbye to Marlon Brando
Say goodbye to latitudes and the confusion that surrounds you
Say goodbye to misery, say goodbye to the morning news
Say goodbye to prime time and the fools that choose to view
Say goodbye to Wendy, say goodbye to Rhonda
Say goodbye to the Beach Boys from the Palisades to Kona

Say goodbye to Glasnost, say goodbye to Malathion
Say goodbye to the clowns in congress and the belt around Orion
Say goodbye to the tabloids, say goodbye to diet soda
Say goodbye to new age music from the Capa to the Coda
Say goodbye to gridlock, goodbye to Dolly's chest
Goodbye to the ozone layer if there's any of it left

Don't it make you want to crawl back to the womb
Find a sanitarium rent yourself a room
This overload is edging me further out to sea
I need to put some distance between overkill and me, me

Say goodbye to Jackie Collins, say goodbye to illiterate fools
Goodbye to evangelists and geeks with power tools
Goodbye to statuettes, say goodbye to lists
Say goodbye to articles on who the senator kissed
Say goodbye to hair styles, goodbye to heaven's gate
Goodbye to Rocky Five, Six, Seven and Eight


When are you gonna come down
When are you going to land
I should have stayed on the farm
I should have listened to my old man

You know you can't hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This boy's too young to be singing the blues

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough

Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road

What do you think you'll do then
I bet that'll shoot down the plane
It'll take you a couple of vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again

Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you on the ground

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough

Back to the howling old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny back toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road


Why's it never light on my lawn
Why does it rain
And never say good-day to the new-born
On the big screen they showed us the sun
But not as bright in life as the real one
It's never quite the same as the real one

And tell me grey seal
How does it feel
To be so wise
To see through eyes
That only see what's real
Tell me grey seal

I never learned why meteors were formed
I only farmed in schools
That were so warn and torn
If anyone can cry then so can I
I read books and draw life from the eye
All my life is drawings from the eye

And tell me grey seal
How does it feel
To be so wise
To see through eyes
That only see what's real
Tell me grey seal

Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
The roots were formed by twisted roots
Your roots were twisted then
I was re-born before all life could die
The Phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
If the Phoenix bird can fly then so can I

And tell me grey seal
How does it feel
To be so wise
To see through eyes
That only see what's real
Tell me grey seal


As I lay dreaming in my bed
Across the great divide
I thought I heard the trawler boats
Returning on the tide
And in this vision of my home
The shingle beach did ring
I saw the lights along the pier
That made my senses sing

Oh oh Grimsby, a thousand delights
Couldn't match the sweet sights
Of my Grimsby
Oh England you're fair
But there's none to compare with my Grimsby
Through nights of mad youth
I have loved every sluice in your harbour
And in your wild sands from boyhood to man
Strangers have found themselves fathers

Take me back you rustic town
I miss your magic charm
Just to smell your candy floss
Or drink in the Skinners Arms
No Cordon Bleu can match the beauty
Of your pies and peas
I want to ride your fairground
Take air along the quay


Yeah, I looked at my watch and it said a quarter to five
The headlines screamed that I was still alive
I couldn't understand it
I thought I died last night

Oh, I dreamed I'd been in a border town
In a little cantina that the boys had found
I was desperate to dance
Just to dig the local sounds

When along came a se'orita
She looked so good that I had to meet her
I was ready to approach her with my English charm
When her brass knuckled boyfriend grabbed me my the arm

And he said, "grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
We no like to with the gringo fight
But there might be a death in Mexico tonight
If you can't grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
Take my advice, take the next flight
And grow your funk, grow your funk at home."

Well, I looked for support from the rest of my friends
For their vanishing trick they get ten out of ten
I knelt to pray
Just to see if he would comprehend


Hand it over
Reach across the line
Let's talk about it, tell me one more time
What is it you want
What you think you'll find
Inside of this old heart of mine
Come on out
'Cause you wanna play
The rain went east, come to roll away
Here you went to choose and you're gonna stay
So I knew that's the price I pay

Can't you tell the deal's been done
Won't you let me love you
I don't see no smoking gun
I'm not up here to judge you
What do you see when you look at me
Tell the man to measure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure

I roamed around
Looking for a clue
Searched the world it's what I used to do
Where I went
What I went though
A bit too hard to find a way to you
I can't move so
Never really could
Sing a song that you understood
It's what you do when you think you should
Surrender like you knew you always would

Can't you tell the deal's been done
Won't you let me love you
I don't see no smoking gun
I'm not up here to judge you
What do you see when you look at me
Tell the man to measure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure

Hold out, distilling down
What's it gonna be
Never tell
In a million years
No, you can't get enough of me

Can't you tell the deal's been done
Won't you let me love you
I don't see no smoking gun
I'm not up here to judge you
What do you see when you look at me
Tell the man to measure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure


You win again, you gypsy heart
I count the days that we're apart
I sleep alone when you're away
No sense in saying I wish you'd stay

It's all the same, you never change
You come and go just like the rain
I pray each day that you are gone
This time it won't be so long

Your gypsy heart will never find
Any arms as warm as mine
And gypsy, when we meet again
I'll play my part and wrap you up inside my arms
Oh, you gypsy heart

Your gypsy heart can always call
When your back's against the wall
And darling, then I'll just pretend right from the start
You never left me on my own
Oh, you gypsy heart

I pray each day that you are gone
This time, oh, it won't be so long

Your gypsy heart will never find
Any arms as warm as mine
And gypsy, when we meet again
I'll play my part and wrap you up inside my arms
Oh, you gypsy heart

Your gypsy heart can always call
When your back's against the wall
And darling, then I'll just pretend right from the start
You never left me on my own
Oh, you gypsy heart

Your gypsy heart will never find
Any arms as warm as mine
And gypsy, when we meet again
I'll play my part and wrap you up inside my arms
Oh, you gypsy heart

Your gypsy heart can always call
When your back's against the wall
And darling, then I'll just pretend right from the start
You never left me on my own
Oh, you gypsy heart



Sometimes I think I'm going crazy
Staring at the same four walls
Waiting for the working day to end
Then I get home so wasted, worn out
I curse at you and tell you
How I've done the work of ten to fifteen men
How I've struggled for my money
Sweated blood to get us by, yeah
Well I'm tired of it honey
Think I'm gonna have to leave here for a while

All you hear are hard luck stories
And the ways I look at life
And the way I think the world treats me
And the way that I treat my wife

I never seem to look at you
And see that somewhere underneath
A pair of tired eyes are crying out
Well you know I work hard all day long
Let me kiss you once with meaning
Just to kill this nagging doubt
Well you don't deny I do you proud
And you expect me to be tired
You say there's no future in our lives
While I persist I'm putting out the fire

All you hear are hard luck stories
Just a few well chosen words
'Cause you're still the woman of a working man
You've got the heart of a working girl


Hello, baby hello
Haven't seen your face for a while
Have you quit doing time for me
Or are you still the same spoiled child

Hello, I said hello
Is this the only place you thought to go
Am I the only man you ever had
Or am I just the last surviving friend that you know

Harmony and me
We're pretty good company
Looking for an island
In our boat upon the sea
Harmony, gee I really love you
And I want to love you forever
And dream of the never, never, never leaving harmony

Hello, baby hello
Open up your heart and let your feelings flow
You're not unlucky knowing me
Keeping the speed real slow
In any case I set my own pace
By stealing the show, say hello, hello

Harmony and me
We're pretty good company
Looking for an island
In our boat upon the sea
Harmony, gee I really love you
And I want to love you forever
And dream of the never, never, never leaving harmony
Never leaving harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Harmony
Ha


Have you heard the dogs at night
Somewhere on the hill
Chasing some poor criminal
And I guess they're out to kill

Oh there must be shackles on his feet
And mother in his eyes
Stumbling through the devil-dark
With the hound pack in full cry

Have mercy on the criminal
Who is running from the law
Are you blind to the winds of change
Don't you hear him any more

Praying Lord you got to help me
I am never gonna sin again
Just take these chains from around my legs
Sweet Jesus I'll be your friend

Now have you ever seen the white teeth gleam
While you lie on a cold damp ground
You're taking in the face of a rifle butt
While the wardens hold you down

And you've never seen a friend in years
Oh it turns your heart to stone
You jump the walls and the dogs run free
And the grave's gonna be your home

Oh, have mercy on the criminal
Who is running from the law
Are you blind to the winds of change
Don't you hear him any more

Praying Lord you got to help me
I am never gonna sin again
Just take these chains from around my legs, ooh
Sweet Jesus I'll be your friend

Ooh, have mercy on the criminal
Who is running from the law
Are you blind to the winds of change
Don't you hear him any more

Praying Lord you got to help me
I am never gonna sin again
Just take these chains from around my legs
Sweet Jesus I'll be your friend


I never dreamed I could cry so hard
That ain't like a man
I could fly like a bird somedays
Had a place where I could land

I could have sworn we were all locked in
Ain't that what you said
I never knew it could hurt so bad
When the power of love is dead

But giving into the nightime
Ain't no cure for the pain
You gotta wade into the water
You gotta learn to live again

Chorus

And reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends,
Touch me now and let me see again,
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands

I never knew love like poison
That burned like a fire
All I ever wanted was a reason
To drowm in your eyes

I never knew sleep so restless
Empty arms so cold
That's not the way it's supposed to be
It ain't the spell that I was sold

But giving into the nightime
Ain't no cure for the pain
You gotta wade into the water
You gotta learn to live again

And reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends,
Touch me now and let me see again,
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands

But giving into the nightime
Ain't no cure for the pain
You gotta wade into the water
You gotta learn to live again

Reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends,
Touch me now and let me see again,
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands

Reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends,
Touch me now and let me see again,
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands

Reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends,
Touch me now and let me see again,
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands


I've got a good by-line, they all know my name
The queen of the sly line, I feed on your fame
But I got my heart in the right place; it's all in the game

If you're doing fine, boy, you got my vote
But step out of line, boy, and I'll go for your throat
'Cause I got my heart in the right place, so give me a quote

I'll ask you some questions, I'll tell you some lies
You'll open your heart like a friend
I'll make up some answers you won't recognize
The you I create with my pen
But my heart's in the right place now and again

My heart's in the right place, know what I mean?
My heart's in the right place, on page seventeen

I'll ask you some questions, I'll tell you some lies
You don't understand, but you will
I'll make up some answers, cut you down to size
Then I move in for the kill
But my heart's in the right place
My heart's in the right place
My heart's in the right place; it's part of the skill

Heart's in the right place
I'm gonna destroy you and your reputation
Don't count for nothing with me
'Cause I'm an old bitch, you see, and my heart's in the right place
Don't you agree?

Heart's in the right place, just wait and see
Heart's in the right place, don't you agree?


Well I'm running away
From this house on the hill
There's a devil inside
Sitting on the window sill

And it's a wild Friday night
And I'm all on my own
I knocked on every door in town
There ain't one little girl that's home

And everybody's got a date
And the ones that ain't are tired
What the hell do you do on a weekend honey
When your heart's on fire

And you can go from Tokyo to Rome
Looking for a girl
But it looks to me like the weekend means
Heartache all over the world

Girls, girls, girls
Have pity on me
Oh it looks to me like the weekend means
Heartache, heartache all over the world

He's got lipstick on his collar
She's got fishnets on her legs
I'm at home and I've got nothing
Just a cold and aching head

There must be something dirty
Just blame it on the magazines
Don't read that trash it'll drive you crazy
`Cause the cops invade your dreams

And everybody's got a date
And the one's that ain't are tired
What the hell do you do on a weekend honey
When your heart's on fire


We are currently missing these lyrics.


Shakey wake up thirsty from a night in the bar
And snake hips Joe is Mr. Cool
Out on the boulevard
The pimp from the Jack of Diamonds
Just got another Jane Doe
She just got off the last bus from Montecedo

Sailor boys find trouble in the alien state
It's one on one from Las Palmas to the Golden Gate
Fly boys on the corner waiting for a ride
For twenty bucks he'll pull the cork on the man inside

`Cause we're rolling in heavy traffic
Judy's in the jump seat and Jody's in the bucket
Billy likes to drive and Jackie's just high
And Cindy thinks we're all gonna commit suicide
`Cause we're rolling in heavy traffic
Yeah we're rolling in heavy traffic

Mack he's got his Marlboros tucked up in his sleeve
He's shacked up in his basement making P.C.P.
He used to shake the french fries
Down on 12th and Maine
And now he stays up nights on apple juice and cocaine


Just like a broken marriage, when two people just don't care
Like when the cupboard is empty or there's no food in the Frigidaire
I'm a page from the end of the story
No closer to my hope and glory
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind

How come it gets so disturbing when two ships pass in the storm?
Who knows how high the crow flies, who knows where this refugee was born?
I'm a page from the end of the story
No closer to my hope and glory
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind

And just for the sake of all these reasons
Rains wash out the fires within
Fires that help to keep you moving
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind

You don't deserve that treatment; I can't pretend I was that nice
I'm no E-ticket ride to Disneyland, I'm no cushy first class flight
I'm a day behind your restless wings
You - you'd rather have the wealth of kings
Me - I'd rather be on the heels of the wind


Feel a feeling light
Headed out to see the sights
Ain't life a many splendored thing?

Duckin' up and out
All those crazy sights and sounds
Bounce around like puppets on a string

Never gonna find
Anything to change my mind
Famous last lines of a fool

Just when do you think
You're a chain with just one link
Something comes to tip you off your stool

Hello, hello
My, my, my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise

Hello, hello
I'm not alone, it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello

Do a dizzy dance
Twirl around and take a chance
Nothing's easy, nothing comes for free

Sniffing all the flowers
Running through an autumn shower
Compare it to someone else like me

Hello, hello
My, my, my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise

Hello, hello
I'm not alone, it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello

And I can fly on the back of a bird
And I can shake all leaves from a tree
If there's a quest of a knight, I'll just follow right
Do this better than the one I used to be

Hello, hello
My, my, my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise

Hello, hello
I'm not alone, it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
(Hello)

Hello, hello
My, my, my, what have we here?
What a surprise
What a surprise

Hello, hello
I'm not alone, it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
(Hello)

Hello
(Hello)
Hello
Hello, hello


Ooh I got a busted wing and a hornet sting
Like an out of tune guitar
Ooh she got Hercules on her side
And Diana in her eyes

Some men like the Chinese life
Some men kneel and pray
Ooh well I like women and I like wine
And I've always liked it that way
Always liked it that way

Doo wop shoo bop
Doo wop shoo bop
Doo wop shoo bop, ah

I can't dig it, the way she tease
That old tough man routine up her sleeve
Living and loving, kissing and hugging
Living and loving with a cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules

Oh it hurts like hell to see my gal
Messing with a muscle boy
No superman gonna ruin my plans
Playing with my toys

Rich man sweating in a sauna bath
Poor boy scrubbing in a tub
Me, I stay gritty up to my ears
Washing in a bucket of mud
Washing in a bucket of mud

Doo wop shoo wop
Doo wop shoo wop
Doo wop shoo wop, ah

I can't dig it, the way she tease
That old tough man routine up her sleeve
Living and loving, kissing and hugging
Living and loving with a cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules

Doo wop shoo wop
Doo wop shoo wop
Doo wop shoo wop, ah

I can't dig it, the way she tease
That old tough man routine up her sleeve
Living and loving, kissing and hugging
Living and loving with a cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules


Like I said baby
If you go astray
Well then go on
Go your own sweet way
I thought you knew by now
You do just what you please
And here's to the next time
Here's to the next time

How many times
Have you gone before
And how many times
Have I forgiven you once more
Never had to wait
Like I waited for you
And here's to the next time
Here's to the next time

When you're gone
The time drags by
I wish you'd learn
Not to make me cry
To make me cry

So if you're gonna leave me
Never to come back
Break it to me gently
Or my world will crack
So be sure to let me know
That I'll never say
Here's to the next time
Here's to the next time
Here's to the next time


It's a constant struggle getting up that hill
There's a change of guard every day
When you're clinging onto a driftwood boat
You pray a great white whale might come your way

No freeway traffic in the frozen North
Just a chain link fence full of birds
And when the harpoon's loaded in the cannon bay
You'll be rolling through the pages lost for words

Hey Ahab can you tell me where
I can catch a ride out of here
Hey Ahab hoist that sail
You gotta stand up straight
When you ride that whale

In a crumbling city we were trapped for days
With a broken sun above the clouds
Caught like Jonah forty fathoms down
And a sign on the wall says, "Hope Allowed"

All the cryptic symbols carved on bone
A far cry from a tattooed rose
And when the boys in the rigging catch the wind
We'll all weigh anchor and it's westward ho

Hey Ahab can you tell me where
I can catch a ride out of here
Hey Ahab hoist that sail
You gotta stand up straight
When you ride that whale

Hey Ahab can you tell me where
I can catch a ride out of here
Hey Ahab hoist that sail
You gotta stand up straight
When you ride that whale

Hey Ahab can you tell me where
I can catch a ride out of here
Hey Ahab hoist that sail
You gotta stand up straight
When you ride that whale


Hier encore, j'avais vingt ans, je caressais le temps
J'ai jou' de la vie
Comme on joue de l'amour et je vivais la nuit
Sans compter sur mes jours qui fuyaient dans le temps
J'ai fait tant de projets qui sont rest's en l'air
J'ai fond' tant d'espoirs qui se sont envol's
Que je reste perdu, ne sachant o' aller
Les yeux cherchant le ciel, mais le c'ur mis en terre

Hier encore, j'avais vingt ans, je gaspillais le temps
En croyant l'arr'ter
Et pour le retenir, m'me le devancer
Je n'ai fait que courir et me suis essouffl'
Ignorant le pass', conjuguant au futur
Je pr'c'dais de moi toute conversation
Et donnais mon avis que je voulais le bon
Pour critiquer le monde avec d'sinvolture
Hier encore, j'avais vingt ans mais j'ai perdu mon temps
' faire des folies
Qui me laissent au fond rien de vraiment pr'cis
Que quelques rides au front et la peur de l'ennui
Car mes amours sont mortes avant que d'exister
Mes amis sont partis et ne reviendront pas
Par ma faute j'ai fait le vide autour de moi
Et j'ai g'ch' ma vie et mes jeunes ann'es
Du meilleur et do pire en jetant le meilleur
J'ai fig' mes sourires et j'ai glac' mes pleurs
O' sont-ils ' pr'sent?
' pr'sent
Mes vingt ans
